// an outcome-phase script judgment: does one file in the reconstructed
// workspace contain every substring the factor expects.
//
// docs/specs/skill-evaluation.md, "The factor": a script judgment "runs
// with the reconstructed workspace as its working directory and a context
// file as its argument, prints {"result", "evidence"} on stdout, and
// signals a failed judgment by a non-zero exit with a reason on stderr."
// This factor's phase is "outcome", so this script reads the reconstructed
// workspace itself — its own cwd — rather than the diff-and-task material
// factor-judgment.mjs's materialFor hands an outcome factor.
//
// check-file-excludes.mjs is this script's negative counterpart, for a
// factor whose expectation is that something is now absent rather than
// present. The file itself lives in the reconstructed workspace, which is
// this process's own cwd (see factor-judgment.mjs's runScriptJudgment); a
// file the input names but the workspace does not have is a judgment
// this script cannot make, not a `false` result, so it exits non-zero
// rather than reporting one.
//
// usage: node check-file-contains.mjs <context.json>
