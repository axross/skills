# Protected Markdownlint Execution

Use the bundled `scripts/markdownlint/` package for actual YAML frontmatter
and explicit fence-closure checks. This file-based foundation covers AS001
and AS010 plus standard Markdown rules; it does **not** replace the three
structure validators in [audit-checklist.md](./audit-checklist.md), their
shared/report responsibilities, or the separate network link-freshness audit.
It supplies the source and execution contract for additional rules, not those
rules themselves.

## Install the bundled package

The private native-ESM package requires Node.js >=22 and these exact runtime
versions: [markdownlint-cli2 0.23.3](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2/tree/v0.23.3)
with its pinned markdownlint 0.41.1, [markdown-it 15.0.1](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/tree/15.0.1),
and [yaml 2.8.2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml/v/2.8.2).
Later dependency versions are not qualified by this contract. The consumer's
own Node or dependency policy may be stricter.

This setup intentionally carries CLI2's complete runtime graph, including
markdownlint's micromark parser and CLI2 configuration loaders. It is not a
dependency-light replacement for the standard-library validators. The dependency
choices preserve these boundaries:

- CLI2 supplies the public custom-rule runner and warning-capable standard
  configuration. The older CLI2/markdownlint pair lacks this warning contract;
  markdownlint alone avoids runner dependencies but abandons this CLI2 foundation.
- yaml supplies decoded scalars and a source-aware AST with no runtime
  dependencies. Node built-ins or a hand-written scanner do not parse YAML 1.2;
  [js-yaml's object loader](https://github.com/nodeca/js-yaml/blob/4.1.0/README.md#api)
  does not supply the required scalar-style/source-range tree.
- markdown-it reuses CLI2's exact parser version without a second installation.
  [Micromark events](https://github.com/micromark/micromark/tree/4.0.2) are a viable,
  already-transitive alternative, but need a different shared-context adapter and
  closure qualification. Another parser adds a graph; hand-written scanning
  recreates list/blockquote semantics. A fence token alone is not proof of closure.

After installing or copying this skill, pack its bundled package and install
the resulting archive from your consumer project. Substitute the absolute path
to your copied skill; the archive is local, not a registry publication:

```bash
npm pack /absolute/path/to/copied-skill/scripts/markdownlint --ignore-scripts --pack-destination .
npm install --ignore-scripts ./agent-skill-markdownlint-0.0.0.tgz
node node_modules/agent-skill-markdownlint/cli.mjs --skill ./skills/example-skill
```

Installation can require network access; validation does not. Keep the consumer
lockfile and install dependencies before entering a network-disabled session.
A plain copied `.mjs` without its dependencies is not a supported setup. Do not
resolve runtime imports through the author's repository or an agent's global
skill directory. No `node_modules` belongs in the distributed skill.

## Declare inputs and scope

The CLI accepts repeatable `--skill DIR` for individual skills and
`--collection DIR` for collections. Every immediate directory in a collection,
including directory symlinks, requires a readable `SKILL.md`. It recursively
includes `references/**/*.md`; nested references stay visible for later rules.
Empty collections, zero selected documents, missing parents, invalid UTF-8,
read failures and reference-directory cycles fail preflight.

Reference directories, including `references` itself, must resolve inside the
canonical owning skill root. An external directory target fails preflight with
exit 2 before its contents are read; a prefix-sharing sibling is still external.
Internal directory links remain traversable, with cycle detection. Explicit
skill/collection-root links and existing reference-file/focused-file aliases
remain supported. This directory boundary is not a filesystem sandbox: file
aliases may still target external files.

`--file FILE` selects focused documents. Declared roots still undergo parent
preflight before that selection. A file within their inventory retains its
skill/reference kind; an unrelated file receives standard checks only.
`--rule AS001` selects a focused custom-rule set. Both options label the run
`partial`, never complete skill validation. `W1-full` means all selected root
documents and AS001/AS010 plus the configured standard checks, not all
structural requirements. Output lists roots, document identities, rule scope
and the aggregate exit.

The supported exit contract is:

| Exit | Meaning                                                                    |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Successful declared-scope validation, including genuine warning advisories |
| 1    | Rule violations                                                            |
| 2    | Invocation, input, configuration, loading, runtime or coverage failure     |

**Guidelines:**

- MUST use declared skill or collection roots for mandatory checks, not a glob whose passing subset hides a missing `SKILL.md`.
- MUST retain the existing structure checks until the receiving project explicitly migrates their remaining responsibilities; `W1-full` alone does not satisfy them.
- MUST treat only exit 0 as success, and retain a focused run's partial scope in reports.

## Separate standard configuration from mandatory checks

`--config FILE` accepts an explicit JSON standard-rule object. Without it,
standard rules default to enabled. Their options, warning severity and inline
exceptions work through the public `markdownlint-cli2/markdownlint/promise`
API. For example, `{"default": false, "MD009": {"br_spaces": 0}}` selects only
the standard trailing-space check.

The helper deliberately does not inherit parent/local CLI2 configuration,
globs, ignores, fixes or plugins. The mandatory custom pass hides configuration
discovery, supplies its rules directly, disables inline configuration and
frontmatter removal, and forces AS001/AS010 on at error severity. A standard
config setting `AS001: false`, an inline disable, or an inherited ignore cannot
suppress those mandatory checks. No document is auto-fixed.

CLI2 alone is not this guarantee: it converts rule exceptions to diagnostics,
so a crashed warning rule can exit successfully, even with its diagnostic
hidden by an inline exception. Standard execution uses
`handleRuleFailures: false`; custom execution records synchronous throws and
rejected promises independently of severity. Results must cover every selected
standard document, and successful custom callbacks witness every
document/rule pair. A coverage gap or exception overrides green sub-pass
results with exit 2. Completely disabled standard rules do not execute and
are not a runtime-failure control.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST use `runValidation` or the bundled CLI for the protected execution contract; directly loading `createRules` into an arbitrary CLI2 config supplies no preflight, coverage or failure-ledger guarantee.
- MUST pass standard configuration explicitly instead of relying on ambient CLI2 configuration discovery.
- MUST keep genuine advisories separate from infrastructure failures, even when both originate in warning rules.

## Consume the shared source context

The package's public ESM entries are:

```javascript
import { createRules, createConfiguration } from "agent-skill-markdownlint";
import { createContext } from "agent-skill-markdownlint/context";
import { runValidation } from "agent-skill-markdownlint/run";

const context = await createContext({ collections: ["./skills"] });
const result = await runValidation(context, {
  standardConfig: { default: true },
});
process.exitCode = result.code;
```

`createContext` accepts `skills`, `collections` and optional focused `files`.
It returns declared `roots`, `skillDirs`, a `documents` Map keyed by absolute
path, and `partial`. Each document carries `path`, `kind` (`skill`, `reference`
or `markdown`), owning `skillDir`, exact `bytes` and decoded `raw`, the leading
`frontmatter` block/boundary, `bodyOffset` in lines, and shared Markdown tokens.
Both passes use the captured strings, even if disk content changes afterward.
`params.lines` is preprocessed Markdown, not raw bytes. This contract does not
cover unsaved editor buffers.

`runValidation` accepts `additionalRules`, their explicit `ruleConfig`, and
optional focused `rules`. It returns `code`, `scope`, `roots`, `documents`,
`rules`, `findings` and `failures`. Standard and custom findings use the same
absolute paths listed in `documents`; CLI2 formatter-relative names are resolved
against the execution directory. Duplicate/unavailable identities, malformed
rules, runtime failures and disabled required execution fail rather than
silently disappearing. Consumers supply extensions directly; the helper does
not import configuration-discovered plugins.

## Interpret AS001 and AS010

AS001 parses only a leading, explicitly closed `---` YAML block using YAML 1.2
core, strict parsing and unique keys. The top level is a mapping. Required
`name` and `description` are nonempty decoded strings represented on one source
line. Names are
kebab-case, at most 64 characters, and match the owning directory. Descriptions
are at most 1,024 decoded UTF-8 bytes, not source spelling length.

Legal plain/single-quoted/double-quoted forms and YAML escapes are accepted.
Required fields reject plain inline-comment truncation, block/multiline forms,
aliases, anchors, explicit tags and non-string values. Optional metadata and
host extensions remain accepted as valid YAML; the check does not establish
that a receiving host supports them. Alias graphs are never expanded.
Parser errors and diagnostics retain original LF/CRLF source lines. See
[frontmatter-and-naming.md](./frontmatter-and-naming.md) for authoring choices.

AS010 uses body fence tokens from markdown-it. Only parser input gets normalized
line endings and a terminal newline: the raw snapshot stays untouched. That
newline retains an empty final list/blockquote content line. Fence maps and
content-line counts then distinguish an explicit matching closer from EOF or
container auto-closing, including empty fences without final newlines. Longer
matching markers close; shorter/wrong markers and over-indented closers do not.
Findings point to the original opener, including the frontmatter line offset.
Fenced YAML examples are not document frontmatter, and unrelated Markdown does
not receive skill rules.
