description: Updating a project's own documentation when a change alters what it says, and reading it before planning one — the `docs/` tree recording what the project is and how it works now, and the mechanism that corrects it when a change makes it wrong. Triggers on "docs/", "spec", "domain model", "glossary", "ubiquitous language", "ADR", "where does this decision go", "the docs are stale", "is this documented anywhere", "conventions/", "operations/". Not spec-driven development — a plan drives the change and this records what became true, so "spec-first" and "generate from the spec" route elsewhere; the plan document itself belongs to a PRD capability, and sentence-level craft to a technical-writing one. Covers conventions and operations, where a settled constraint and its rationale live, and three single-purpose validators.

# Living Project Documentation

Use this capability to keep a project's own documentation — what the product is,
the language its domain speaks, how it currently behaves, and the conventions and
operational procedures the project keeps alongside them, each carrying the
constraints that bind it and the reasoning behind them — true as the code
changes, and to read it before planning a change rather than discovering it
afterwards.

The weight is on **upkeep**. Documentation that is only ever created is a
liability: it accumulates claims nobody re-checks, and a reader cannot tell
which of them still hold. What makes it worth keeping is a mechanism that
corrects it, tied to the change that invalidated it. That mechanism is the whole
subject here; creating documents is the small part.

Two claims this capability does **not** make. It does not promise to make an
agent better at its task — the evidence for context files improving task success
is weak, and the design below assumes a body is read only when a task needs it,
rather than loaded on every turn. And it does not drive development from a
specification: the plan drives the change, and what becomes true is recorded
here once it lands.

Everything below writes `docs/`, the conventional location for this material. A
project that already keeps it somewhere else substitutes its own path
everywhere `docs/` appears; nothing here depends on the name.

A worked instance of the shape below ships at
[docs-example/index.md](./assets/docs-example/index.md) — six files across two
real domains, demonstrating every relational rule this skill states: the
spec-to-spec precondition link, a settled constraint carried by the spec that
governs it with its rationale and its rejected alternatives beside it, and a
convention deferring to a named capability. Copy its structure rather than
starting from a blank template.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## What This Does Not Cover

Two neighbouring bodies of documentation are always out of scope, because each
already has an owner and pulling either in is what turns `docs/` into a junk
drawer:

| Not this                                                            | Where it belongs                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The plan for a change — what is about to be built                   | A product-requirement or plan-document capability, recorded with the change |
| How to write a clear sentence, and which document type to reach for | A technical-writing capability                                              |

The line against the plan is the one worth stating twice, because both
describe the product and only the tense differs: **a plan describes the diff, a
specification describes the steady state.** When a change merges, the part of
the plan that became true is absorbed here; the plan itself stays where it is,
as the record of a decision made at a point in time.

Two more bodies are out of scope for their **content** only, not their shape:
this capability neither writes a project's contributor documentation nor
invents its code conventions.

| Not this (its content)                                         | Where the content comes from                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| README, setup steps, how to run the tests, deployment runbooks | The project's contributor documentation            |
| What the code's layout and conventions are                     | The project's own repository-structure conventions |

A project that keeps either under `docs/` anyway — in `conventions/` or
`operations/`, beside `specs/` — has this capability's own
rules for the **shape** that content takes, even though the content itself is
still decided elsewhere: see
[Conventions and Operations](#conventions-and-operations).

## The Three Modes

| Mode          | When                                     | What happens                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consult**   | Before writing a plan                    | Read the index, open the one or two documents the task touches, follow their dependency and decision links, and name in the plan which documents the change will invalidate     |
| **Upkeep**    | In the same change that alters behaviour | Correct what the change invalidated — restate facts, write a newly settled constraint into the document that governs it, add a spec for new behaviour, repoint stale references |
| **Bootstrap** | A project with no `docs/` adopted yet    | Detect whatever convention already exists and follow it; propose the default shape only where there is none                                                                     |

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read `index.md` before proposing a plan for a change to a documented area, and name in that plan every document the change will invalidate.
- MUST correct what a change invalidated in the same change, never as follow-up work — a document corrected separately is wrong for the interval between the two, and the interval has a way of not ending.
- MUST NOT copy a plan's forward-looking text into a document verbatim; restate what is now true in the present tense, and drop what did not land.
- MUST run the validators this skill bundles over `docs/` whenever a change touches it, and fix what they report before calling the change done.
- SHOULD leave a document alone when a change did not alter what it claims; an edit that only restyles prose adds review surface and no truth.

## The Shape

`docs/` holds two files read across every body it has — `index.md` and
`glossary.md` — and up to three bodies beneath them: `specs/` is this
capability's own; `conventions/` and `operations/` are the two normative bodies
described in [Conventions and Operations](#conventions-and-operations). A rule
stated in [documentation-structure.md](./references/documentation-structure.md)
is **shared** — it holds for every document, whichever body it sits in. A rule
that names one body — present tense and the glossary pairing for `specs/`; the
format in [Conventions and Operations](#conventions-and-operations) for
`conventions/` and `operations/` — is **body-specific**, and applies nowhere
else.

See [documentation-structure.md](./references/documentation-structure.md) for:

- the shape every `docs/` tree takes, and what each of `index.md`, `glossary.md`, `specs/<domain>.md`, `conventions/`, and `operations/` owns
- the shared invariants, including why a document exists only when it holds what no other document holds, and why `index.md` and `glossary.md` still earn their place under that rule
- the `index.md` layout — the opening prose naming each body, the per-body headings, and why only `index.md` is read unconditionally
- what a glossary entry holds, why a spec covers a domain rather than a model, and two rules no validator can enforce
- where a Mermaid diagram goes, and why there is no `diagrams/` directory

## Conventions and Operations

See [conventions-and-operations.md](./references/conventions-and-operations.md) for:

- what `conventions/` and `operations/` each hold, and the where-a-violation-appears test that decides between them
- the recommendation that makes one `docs/` tree the bootstrap default for a project with no established documentation convention, and why it never overrides an existing one
- the format a document under either follows — a rule stated once next to its reasoning, its strength readable from the sentence, one document per surface in kebab-case, named for the field it already uses, deferring the general practice to the capability that owns it
- how a constraint settled about a convention or a procedure lands in the document it governs, exactly as a product constraint lands in its spec
- the same-change upkeep obligation for a convention or a procedure a change alters
- the SHOULD, not MUST, on routing a contributor or an agent to a specific document from an always-loaded instruction file
- which of the five validators see a document under either body and which do not

## Cross-References

See [cross-references.md](./references/cross-references.md) for:

- the single rule that decides every link: a reference exists only where it carries what the structure does not already encode
- the per-reference verdict table, including why the glossary links into nothing
- the dependency condition that keeps `specs/` from becoming a link mesh
- why a constraint's rationale is prose beside it rather than a link out to something else

## Settled Decisions

A settled decision splits in two, and the halves keep different company. The
**constraint** — what future work may and may not do — is not history: it belongs
in the specification, convention, or operations document that governs its
subject, written in the present tense, with the reasoning that makes it legible
in the sentences beside it. The **deliberation** — what was weighed, what it
cost, what was given up — is history, and stays in the plan that proposed the
change and the commit that carried it.

So `docs/` holds no decision log, and this capability's three bodies are the
three above. A reader asking "why is it done this way?" reads the answer where
the rule is stated, instead of following a link to a record whose subject they
then have to reconstruct.

One case has to be stated, because it is the one such a tree loses by accident:
a rejected alternative leaves nothing behind to attach its reasoning to. Nobody
searches history for a word the repository does not contain, so the rejection is
written into the governing document as a constraint of its own — what this
project does not do, and what a later reader would otherwise reach for.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST write a settled constraint into the specification, convention, or
  operations document that governs its subject, in the present tense, with its
  rationale in the prose beside it — never as a record of its own, and never in
  `index.md`.
- MUST merge the constraint into what that document already says, rather than
  appending a section that restates the subject from the beginning; one fact
  lives in one document, and that does not relax for a fact settled later than
  the prose around it.
- MUST state a rejected alternative that left no trace in the tree as a
  constraint in the governing document, naming what the project does not do and
  why, so a later reader meets it by reading rather than by searching history
  for a word they do not have.
- MUST NOT create `decisions/`, `adr/`, or any other body under `docs/` holding
  rationale separated from the rule it explains; a project that already keeps
  one is handled by
  [bootstrapping.md](./references/bootstrapping.md#detect-before-proposing).
- MUST leave the deliberation with the change that settled it — the plan and the
  commit — rather than copying it into `docs/`, which imports the plan's tense
  and its speculation for upkeep to keep true afterwards.

## Consulting and Upkeep

See [consulting-and-upkeep.md](./references/consulting-and-upkeep.md) for:

- reading the index first and stopping there when nothing matches
- the invalidation table — which kind of code change puts which document in question
- absorbing a merged plan into the present tense without importing its speculation
- replacing a constraint a change overturned, and repointing what a rename left stale

## Bootstrapping docs/

See [bootstrapping.md](./references/bootstrapping.md) for:

- detecting an existing convention before proposing one, and leaving an unrelated `docs/` directory alone
- the smallest `docs/` worth having, and the write order — a first spec's own boundary standing in for what a separate overview page once held
- seeding a glossary from the code's own vocabulary rather than inventing one
- what not to import — runbooks, setup steps, and anything a plan already owns

## Validators

See [validators.md](./references/validators.md) for:

- the three commands, the change each one answers for, and why there is no run-all script
- the two-level opt-in that keeps an unrelated `docs/` directory from turning red
- the boundary between "does this link resolve" and "is this file listed", so no defect is reported twice
- what these deliberately do not check, and why a spec/implementation mismatch is not among them
