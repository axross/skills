description: The ability to store, install, and maintain a project's agent skills across two tiers — repository-local skills committed directly under the skill root (e.g. `.claude/skills/`) and hand-edited in place, and distributable skills authored in a source directory (e.g. `skills/`) and installed into the skill root with the vercel-labs/skills CLI (`npx skills`) plus a `skills-lock.json` lockfile — the decision rule for which tier a new skill belongs to, and how to route a defect or gap you find in an installed skill — edit-and-reinstall when you own its source, or a feature-request issue opened on the upstream repository, with the human's go-ahead, when you do not.
when_to_use: Apply when adding, editing, renaming, moving, or removing an agent skill in a project that manages skills across two tiers, when deciding which tier a new skill belongs to, when `git status` shows the installed copies or `skills-lock.json` out of sync with their source, or when a skill you loaded turns out to be wrong, outdated, or missing a rule — including mid-task, and including when the installed copy came from an upstream you do not own.

# Agent Skill Management

Use this capability whenever you add, edit, rename, move, or remove an agent skill in a project that holds its skills in two tiers. **Distributable** skills — portable capabilities other projects can install — are authored in a source directory (conventionally `skills/`, the source of truth) and **installed** into the skill root (the directory the agent actually loads, conventionally `.claude/skills/`) with the [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI (`npx skills`); a `skills-lock.json` file records what was installed. **Repository-local** skills — the ones that encode a single project's own conventions — are committed directly under the skill root and are never touched by the CLI.

One index — the host project's master skill index — routes to every skill regardless of tier.

This skill is **self-contained**: it names no repository-specific file or layout and references no repository-root index, so it works installed on its own. The directory names `skills/` and `.claude/skills/` and the tooling below are the conventional defaults; substitute the host project's chosen paths where they differ.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST keep the host project's master skill index in sync whenever a skill in either tier is added, renamed, moved, or removed, per your project's skill-authoring conventions.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Choosing a Tier

Every skill lives in exactly one tier, decided by one question: **would the skill work, unchanged, installed into another project?**

- A skill that is self-contained and portable — it names no repository-specific file, workflow, or layout — is **distributable**: author it under the source directory (`skills/<name>/`) and install it with the CLI.
- A skill that encodes one project's own structure or process — a repository-layout skill, a project-specific development baseline, the skill-authoring rules a project tailors to itself — is **repository-local**: commit it directly under the skill root (`.claude/skills/<name>/`).

**Guidelines:**

- MUST place every new skill in exactly one tier using the portability question above, before writing its `SKILL.md`.
- MUST NOT store a repository-local skill under the source directory or manage it with `npx skills`; it never appears in `skills-lock.json`.
- MUST move a skill between tiers deliberately when its scope changes — a repository-local skill later generalized for sharing moves its source to `skills/<name>/` and is reinstalled with the CLI — never by keeping a copy in both.
- MAY read a skill's tier off `skills-lock.json`: a skill listed there is distributable and installed; one absent from it is repository-local.

## Repository-Local Skills

A repository-local skill's committed copy under the skill root **is** its source of truth. The prohibition on hand-editing installed copies does not apply here — editing these files in place is the correct workflow.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST edit a repository-local skill directly under the skill root (`.claude/skills/<name>/`) — its `SKILL.md`, `references/`, and any `scripts/` — and commit those files; there is no separate source directory and no install step.
- MUST author it to the same standard as any other skill — frontmatter, naming, discovery metadata, progressive disclosure — per your project's skill-authoring conventions.
- MUST rename a repository-local skill with a `git mv` of its directory plus a matching frontmatter `name` update, and update every reference to the old name in the same change.

## Distributable Skills: Install and Refresh

A distributable skill is authored under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (with its `references/` beside it) and installed with the CLI. The CLI is run through `npx`; when the environment does not support symlinks, installs use `--copy` (the copy lands as a real directory under the skill root).

**Commands:**

- Install or refresh every managed skill:

  ```bash
  npx skills add ./skills --agent claude-code --skill '*' --yes --copy
  ```

- Refresh a single skill by name:

  ```bash
  npx skills add ./skills --agent claude-code --skill <name> --yes --copy
  ```

- List installed skills: `npx skills list`
- Remove an installed skill: `npx skills remove <name>` (then delete its `skills/<name>/` source and update the master skill index).

**Guidelines:**

- MUST author a distributable skill under the source directory (`skills/<name>/`), never directly under the skill root.
- MUST NOT hand-edit an installed copy under the skill root when you own its source; edit the source and reinstall.
- MUST re-run the install after editing any source skill so the committed installed copy and `skills-lock.json` match the source.
- MUST commit the installed `.claude/skills/<name>/` copies and `skills-lock.json` alongside the `skills/` source; they are tracked artifacts, not gitignored.
- MUST pass `--copy` when symlinks are unsupported; a symlink install leaves the skill root empty or broken there.
- MUST use `--skill '*'` to refresh all managed skills after a broad change, or `--skill <name>` for a targeted one.
- SHOULD run `npx skills add` from the repository root so `./skills` resolves and `skills-lock.json` is written there.
- SHOULD confirm the install summary lists every expected skill as `copied` before committing.
- SHOULD retry with an explicit version specifier (`npx --yes skills@latest …`) when `npx skills` aborts with `could not determine executable to run`; the plain form above stays canonical, and the specifier is a fallback for environments where `npx` cannot resolve the bare package name.

## Proposing a Change to an Installed Skill

A distributable skill's installed copy under the skill root is a **generated artifact**: the next install or `npx skills` upgrade regenerates it from its source and silently discards anything you typed into it. How you change such a skill therefore depends on **whether you own its source**.

The change usually announces itself while you are using the skill rather than before it: you load the skill for some other task and find a rule that is wrong, out of date, or silent on the case in front of you. That finding is what this section acts on. The question it answers is not whether to act — a rule left uncorrected misleads the next reader as it misled you — but where the action lands, and the installed copy is never the answer.

Determine which case you are in from the skill's `source` in `skills-lock.json`:

- The `source` points inside a repository you control (a local path or your own repo) → **you own the source** (first-party); change it locally.
- The `source` points at an upstream repository or registry you do not control → the skill was **installed from outside** (third-party); route the change upstream.

### Acting on What You Found

A finding about a skill arrives in the middle of other work, which is what makes it easy to lose: correcting it in place is forbidden, and the task at hand has its own momentum. Sort it by tier, route it, and carry on — the proposal travels alongside the work rather than displacing it.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST treat a rule you find wrong, outdated, or missing while applying an installed skill as a change to route, not an observation to discard; sort it by the ownership question above before acting on it.
- MUST, when you own the source, make the change locally: edit the source under `skills/<name>/`, reinstall with the CLI, and commit the regenerated installed copy and `skills-lock.json` (see [Distributable Skills: Install and Refresh](#distributable-skills-install-and-refresh)). Never hand-edit the installed copy.
- MUST continue the task that exposed the finding under the skill exactly as installed while a proposal is pending; routing a change never blocks that work, and never licenses acting as though the proposed rule were already in force.
- SHOULD raise what generalizes — a rule that is wrong, outdated, or missing for any user of the skill — and record what only suits your project as a local convention instead of an upstream request.
- SHOULD, when you need a local-only deviation you cannot wait on upstream for, fork the skill into your own distributable source deliberately — copy it under your `skills/<name>/`, repoint its `skills-lock.json` `source`, and manage it first-party from then on — rather than hiding the change as an edit to the installed copy. Record that you have diverged from upstream.
- SHOULD name any proposal you filed or left pending in the work's completion report, so the finding outlives the session that produced it.

### Filing an Upstream Feature Request

The upstream repository is the source of truth for a third-party skill, so changing one means requesting the change there — a feature request or bug report describing the behavior the skill should have. Two facts shape how it is filed: the maintainer who reads it has no access to your project, and opening it is a public write on a repository you do not own.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST NOT hand-edit the installed copy of a skill installed from an upstream you do not own — a reinstall or `npx skills` upgrade overwrites it from upstream, so the edit is lost and, until then, masquerades as source.
- MUST propose a change to a skill installed from outside as a **feature request or bug report on its upstream repository**, resolving that upstream from the skill's `source` in `skills-lock.json`; search its issue tracker first and add to an existing request that already covers the finding rather than filing a duplicate.
- MUST obtain the human's go-ahead on the drafted title and body before opening the issue — it is a public write, under their identity, on a repository the project does not own; a standing instruction to file such findings as they arise is that go-ahead.
- MUST write the request so a maintainer with no access to your project can act on it: the skill and the section or rule at issue, the situation that exposed it, the current behavior and the behavior it should have, and why it generalizes beyond your project.
- MUST keep the upstream proposal to an issue; do not open a pull request on the upstream repository.
- MUST report the finding and the drafted request back to the human instead when the upstream does not resolve to a reachable issue tracker — never drop it, and never edit the installed copy in its place.
- MUST pull an accepted upstream change by re-running the install/upgrade against the upstream source, not by editing files under the skill root.

## The Lockfile

`skills-lock.json` is the install lockfile — analogous to `package-lock.json`. It records each distributable skill's `source`, `sourceType`, and a `computedHash` of the installed content, and is committed so the installed state is reproducible and drift is detectable. Repository-local skills never appear in it.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST commit `skills-lock.json` and regenerate it by running the install command, never by hand-editing.
- MUST treat a `computedHash` change with no corresponding source edit as install drift to investigate, not to blindly commit.
- SHOULD be aware that a `local` `source` is an absolute path, so it can differ between machines; regenerate the lock with the install command in your own checkout rather than expecting a foreign checkout's lock to be byte-identical.

## Verification

Skill changes are documentation changes: they gate on format, lint, and relative-link integrity, plus a skill structure validator where the project ships one.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST run the project's documentation checks (format, lint, relative-link integrity) after any skill change — a direct edit or a reinstall — and fix any failure before committing.
- MUST run the relative-link check whenever a skill's files or links moved, since a stale link inside an installed copy fails the same check as the source.
- MUST confirm, after adding, renaming, moving, or removing a skill or a reference file, that discovery metadata and parent routing still resolve to the change — per your skill-authoring conventions, which own those rules — because a tier move changes paths that discovery and routing depend on.
- SHOULD validate a changed skill with the structure validator your skill-authoring conventions ship, if any.
- SHOULD diff a reinstalled copy against its source (`git diff --stat`) to confirm the reinstall changed exactly the expected files.
