# SSRF and Outbound Fetch

Apply these rules to verify server-side outbound `fetch` calls cannot be steered at internal-network or unintended targets by user- or CMS-controlled content.

## The Outbound-Fetch Risk Surface

Any function that performs a server-side `fetch(url)` where `url` originates from authored/user-controlled content (e.g., a link-preview / embed fetcher that resolves URLs from content) is the principal SSRF surface. Identify the project's equivalents and apply the rules below.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when the diff removes the URL-validity check (e.g., `URL.canParse(href)`) on an authored URL before it flows into a fetch, without replacing it with a stricter check. That parse is often the only filter keeping malformed URLs out.
- MUST flag a Major when the diff adds a new caller that `fetch`-es a user- or CMS-controlled URL without a hostname allowlist or a block-list for internal ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.169.254` — the cloud metadata endpoint, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `localhost`, `*.internal`).
- MUST flag a Major when a new server-side `fetch` follows redirects (the default `redirect: "follow"`) without checking the final `response.url` host against an allowlist. A redirect can land on an internal host even when the initial URL passes the allowlist.
- SHOULD flag a Minor recommendation that any new outbound fetch passes a tight timeout (e.g., `signal: AbortSignal.timeout(<ms>)`) so a hung internal endpoint does not stall the request.

## Image Optimization and Remote Hosts

The image-host allowlist defines which external origins the server will fetch on a visitor's behalf, so a wildcard entry delegates that fetch capability to every host it matches.

- A pre-existing optimized-image component may use an "unoptimized" escape hatch for an externally fetched image URL — flag a Critical only if the diff worsens this (e.g., promotes the image to an eagerly-preloaded position, or replaces the framework's `<Image>`-style component with a raw `<img>`).

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a new entry in the config allowlist of external hosts uses a wildcard hostname or covers more than one origin. Existing entries should be tightly scoped to a single origin.
- MUST flag a Critical when a new component renders a media element with an "unoptimized" / host-check-bypassing source for a user- or CMS-controlled URL whose host is not validated. The "unoptimized" path skips the remote-host allowlist check.

## Social-Preview / Sitemap / Robots

Metadata routes run server-side with no user session in front of them, which makes a fetched URL parameter an unauthenticated proxy into the server's network position.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when a social-preview image route accepts a `src` query parameter that flows into `fetch(src)` without an allowlist. This is the canonical OG-image SSRF pattern.
- MUST flag a Major when sitemap or robots generation performs an unbounded `fetch` to a user- or CMS-controlled URL — those should fetch only data through the project's data-access layer.

## CSRF on Mutation Endpoints

Browsers attach the victim's cookies to cross-site requests automatically, so an unprotected mutation endpoint can be driven by any page the victim merely visits.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a new mutation handler (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) does not check the `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` header for cross-site requests. Even idempotent endpoints can be abused (e.g., to flush caches).
- SHOULD recommend a shared-secret header for new mutation endpoints invoked only by internal hooks (e.g., a data-layer lifecycle hook that triggers revalidation).

## Out-of-Scope

If the data/content layer ships its own admin UI under a dedicated route segment, that segment owns its own CSRF and request validation and is out of scope for this lens. The reviewer MUST NOT flag findings inside that directory per the project's code-review guideline (scoping rules).

**Guidelines:**

- MUST NOT flag findings inside a tool-owned admin route segment per the project's code-review guideline (scoping rules); the data/content layer owns its CSRF and request validation there.
