description: The ability to judge whether a change carries adequate verification evidence before it merges — the reviewer's QA pass on top of the development verification rules. Covers requiring command evidence for the format and lint gate, matching manual checks to the changed output surfaces (non-default content states, not-found handling, dev-server output), mapping skipped checks to residual risk, and demanding second-pass verification after severe findings.
when_to_use: Use when reviewing whether a change has adequate verification evidence — "is this verified", "did this break anything", or "were the required checks run".

# Quality Assurance

Use this capability to judge whether a change has been adequately verified before merge. This is the reviewer's lens — flag missing evidence and link to the developer-facing rule rather than re-deriving it.

The severity labels used throughout (Critical, Major, Minor) are owned by the project's code-review skill; consult it for each tier's definition, fixed floors, and verdict mapping.

## Verification Evidence

See [verification-evidence.md](./references/verification-evidence.md) for:

- Commands run, exit status, and relevant output
- The evidence-adequacy decision flow from changed surface to covered-or-flag
- Manual checks matched to changed output surfaces
- Skipped required checks and residual risk
- Second-pass verification after fixing Critical or Major findings

## Lint and Format Gate

See [lint-and-format-gate.md](./references/lint-and-format-gate.md) for:

- The author ran the format and lint commands per the project's software-development practices (code-quality rules)
- No new inline linter suppressions without an inline justification
- No new lint warnings introduced into modified files

## Manual Verification Evidence

See [manual-verification.md](./references/manual-verification.md) for:

- The author exercised non-default content states when the change touches a data-driven surface
- The not-found UI was verified for routing changes
- The dev-server output was checked for new warnings or errors
