# Progressive Disclosure

Apply this reference when deciding whether to split a `SKILL.md` into reference files, how to wire those files, and when a small skill should remain a single file.

## References Directory Pattern

Progressive disclosure keeps discovery cheap and detail available. In this project, the standard split layout is a parent `SKILL.md` plus Markdown topic files directly under a `references/` subdirectory. The parent routes agents to the right reference; each reference carries the detailed examples, edge cases, and normative rules for one topic.

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── topic-one.md
    └── topic-two.md
```

**Guidelines:**

- MUST use either a single `SKILL.md` or a short `SKILL.md` plus one-level-deep topic references under `references/`.
- MUST use `references/` as the subdirectory name for split Markdown topic files unless the host project explicitly establishes a different convention.
- MUST keep reference files directly under `references/`; do not create deeper reference nesting such as `references/security/input-validation.md`.
- SHOULD keep parent `SKILL.md` focused on scope, routing, and when to load each reference.
- MUST move detailed rule content into reference files once progressive disclosure is introduced.
- SHOULD keep examples, edge cases, lengthy checklists, and topic-specific procedures in reference files rather than in the parent `SKILL.md`.

## Size Thresholds

Size thresholds are review signals, not mechanical quotas. When a skill crosses them, the reader is likely paying too much context to find the relevant rule.

**Guidelines:**

- SHOULD keep `SKILL.md` under about 500 lines and 5,000 tokens.
- SHOULD split or subdivide a skill when one substantive section grows past ten guideline bullets.
- SHOULD split when distinct subtopics emerge that an agent can load independently.
- SHOULD keep each reference file under about 500 lines.
- SHOULD split an oversized reference into sibling references instead of nesting deeper.

## When Not to Split

Splitting adds indirection. A small skill that is easy to scan should stay single-file even if neighboring skills use references.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST NOT split a compact skill purely for symmetry with other skills.
- SHOULD inline a skill that has only one tiny reference file.
- SHOULD avoid reference files shorter than about 30 lines unless the topic is unusually fragile.
- MUST treat progressive disclosure as a remedy for bloat or topic separation, not as a mandatory layout.

## Wiring Reference Files from the Index

The index should let the agent decide what to load without opening every reference. In a split skill, each reference-routing section in `SKILL.md` should use a predictable shape: a topic heading, one `See [file.md](./references/file.md) for:` line, and plain descriptive bullets that name situations, practical use cases, or specific conditions.

**Example:**

```markdown
## Input Validation

See [input-validation.md](./references/input-validation.md) for:

- changing input schemas or URL decoding
- tracing untrusted input fields into metadata, UI, and links
- checking source URL protocol filtering and length limits
```

**Guidelines:**

- MUST link every reference file from the parent `SKILL.md`.
- MUST use the `## Section/Topic Name` + `See [file.md](./references/file.md) for:` + descriptive bullet-list format for reference-routing sections in `SKILL.md`.
- MUST use a stable leading-dot relative link that resolves from the parent file, such as `./references/input-validation.md`.
- MUST use the reference file name as the link label in parent routing sections, such as `[input-validation.md](./references/input-validation.md)`.
- MUST keep parent routing bullets descriptive; do not use RFC-2119-style requirement keywords such as MUST, SHOULD, MAY, REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, or OPTIONAL in these routing bullets.
- MUST put normative requirement bullets in the detailed reference file, not in the parent routing section.
- SHOULD name reference files in kebab-case.
- SHOULD order parent sections by likely consultation order.
- MUST NOT leave orphan reference files under a skill directory.

## Triggering Conditions on Reference Links

A reference link should say when the reader needs it. Without a trigger, the agent must either load everything or guess.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST state the condition that makes each reference relevant.
- SHOULD describe covered topics concretely, such as "the description length limit" or "source URL protocol filtering".
- MUST NOT use empty labels such as "details" or "more information" as the only routing clue.
- SHOULD make triggers narrow enough that the agent can skip irrelevant references.

## Anti-Patterns

Anti-patterns are useful when they name the failure mode and the cost. They should still end in concrete guidelines rather than only warnings.

**Anti-Pattern Examples:**

> Symmetry split: five tiny files created only because another skill has five files.

> Detail leakage: the same MUST rule appears in both SKILL.md and a reference file.

> Deep nesting: references/security/input-validation.md under a skill that expects one level.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST NOT split a skill for visual symmetry alone.
- MUST NOT put detailed normative rules in both the index and a reference file.
- MUST NOT create nested reference directories unless the host project has explicitly adopted that structure.
- SHOULD remove or merge over-fragmented references before adding more.
