# Review Scoping

Apply these rules at the start of every review to bound the work and avoid drifting into unrelated code.

## Reviewer-Mode Reset

For self-review, the same agent that implemented the change must deliberately switch roles before inspecting the diff. The reset creates a fresh review boundary even though it cannot create true independence.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST stop editing before beginning a self-review pass.
- MUST reread the user's latest request and the acceptance criteria before inspecting implementation details.
- MUST run `git status` and inspect the relevant `git diff` before opening changed files.
- MUST treat prior implementation reasoning as untrusted until the diff and verification evidence support it.
- MUST perform a second-pass re-review after fixing any Critical or Major self-review finding.

## Default Scope

A review that wanders into pre-existing code loses track of what the current change is accountable for and dilutes the author's attention across problems they did not introduce.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST default to **only the changed code** — the diff between the working tree (or a PR branch) and `main`. Do not review pre-existing code unless the user explicitly asks for an audit.
- MUST run `git status` and `git diff main..HEAD` (or `git diff` for an uncommitted working tree) before reading any file, to discover the exact set of changed files and lines.
- MUST also inspect untracked files surfaced by `git status` — new files are part of the change.

## Reading Surrounding Context

Correctness lives in context: a hunk that reads correctly on its own can still break the control flow, boundaries, or callers that surround it.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST read the full file containing each changed hunk, not just the diff hunk itself. A line that looks safe in isolation can be unsafe in its surrounding control flow.
- MUST inspect every caller of a changed function and every callee a changed function added a call to.
- SHOULD read the surrounding modules a changed unit participates in (its parent, siblings, and any shared entry point) even when the diff only touches a leaf, because cross-module assumptions (server-vs-client boundaries, test-hook attributes, async/lifecycle boundaries) cross file boundaries.
- SHOULD read the matching test under {{TEST_DIR}} when a changed unit is covered by tests, to confirm whether the tests still cover the change.

## Out-of-Scope Findings

Charging the current change with blocking severity for problems it did not introduce holds it hostage to unrelated work.

**Guidelines:**

- SHOULD NOT report pre-existing issues outside the diff as Critical or Major. They MAY appear as Minor or Nit observations only when they directly affect the safety of the current change (e.g., a pre-existing missing `await` that the new code now depends on).
- SHOULD list pre-existing issues separately under a "Pre-existing observations" section so the author can decide whether to address them in a follow-up.

## When the Diff Is Empty or Unclear

With nothing to diff, there is no defined change to review, and any files the reviewer picks on its own would be a guess at the wrong target.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST ask the user which files or branch to review when `git diff main..HEAD` returns nothing and no PR number was supplied.
- MUST NOT guess. An empty diff with no instruction means the review request is malformed.

## Repository-Specific Boundaries

Style feedback on files the tooling produces is noise the author cannot act on, since the fix would mean changing the generator rather than the file. See the project's development guidelines (change-management rules) for which paths the project treats as generated/managed.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST NOT review generated or tool-managed files (e.g., framework- or data-layer-generated directories, generated type definitions, lockfiles) for code style. See the project's development guidelines (change-management rules) for the project's list.
- MUST NOT review auto-generated data-layer schema migrations for code style. Only flag a migration if it appears to drop a column or rename a field destructively without a data backfill.
- MUST consult the project's own structure / change-management skill (defined during INIT) for the exact set of paths to exclude from review, since these vary per project.
