# Performance and Reliability Requirements

Apply these rules when reviewing the runtime cost and failure-mode behavior of any code change. This is the reviewer's lens — flag risks and link to the developer-facing rule rather than restating it.

## Data-Access Efficiency

<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL key=DATA_LAYER — keep this section OR delete it together with ./references/data-access-efficiency.md. -->

See [data-access-efficiency.md](./references/data-access-efficiency.md) for:

- Explicit projection, relationship depth, result limit, and filter on every data-layer read
- No N+1 pattern: iterating a list of records and re-fetching each related record one at a time
- The data-layer client is acquired once per request and reused, not re-constructed in tight loops
- Visibility-restricted reads do not over-fetch by omitting the appropriate filter

## Server / Client Boundary Cost

See [server-client-boundary.md](./references/server-client-boundary.md) for:

- Independent async work is run concurrently or deferred to where it is consumed, not awaited sequentially into a waterfall
- Loading/streaming boundaries are placed around independently slow units so progressive rendering actually works
- Loading skeletons do not depend on the loaded data shape
- New client-tier units are justified — not promoting an entire server-tier subtree to the client just for one event handler

## Caching Correctness

See [caching-correctness.md](./references/caching-correctness.md) for:

- Caching is paired with a deliberately chosen lifetime/TTL
- Caching is never applied to per-user / per-request / auth data (no cookies, headers, or auth context inside a cached function)
- Invalidation is wired on writes — a new cached data source needs a corresponding write-side invalidation hook
- Invalidation targets the correct scope (the individual view vs. its shared layout/shell)

## Asset and Image Optimization

See [image-optimization.md](./references/image-optimization.md) for:

- Images and large assets go through the framework's optimized asset pipeline rather than raw, unoptimized elements
- Intrinsic dimensions are provided so optimization can apply
- Above-the-fold imagery is prioritized; below-the-fold imagery is lazy-loaded
- New external image hosts are tightly scoped via an allowlist per the project's application-security requirements (ssrf-and-embeds rules)

## Bundle and Dependency Weight

See [bundle-weight.md](./references/bundle-weight.md) for:

- Client-tier files do not import heavyweight or server-only packages (data-layer SDK, content-processing pipelines, the structured logger, an error-tracker server entry, runtime builtins)
- server-only modules imported from a client-tier file, and the likely build-error cause
- Path-aliased imports resolve to the intended tier and do not pull in transitive client-incompatible code
- The bundler's server-external package list is not bloated by entries that could ship to the client

## Error Handling and Observability

See [error-and-observability.md](./references/error-and-observability.md) for:

- `try`/`catch` is at the root call site (request entry point / top-level handler), not in nested helpers, per the project's observability guidelines (error-handling rules)
- The error-reporting call fires before any early "not found" / redirect / return
- Slow or external operations are bracketed by start/complete log pairs per the project's observability guidelines (logging rules)
- New routes/segments have error boundaries when they need custom error UI, and the root/last-resort error boundary is not bypassed
