# Data-Access Efficiency

<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL key=DATA_LAYER — fill the token OR, if the project has no data/content layer, delete this file together with the "Data-Access Efficiency" section in ../SKILL.md and the data-access phrases in that skill's frontmatter description and the AGENTS.md index row. -->
*If this project has no data/content layer, delete this file during INIT (see the marker above for the inbound links).*

Apply these rules to verify that reads against the data/content layer ({{CMS_OR_DATA_LAYER}}) are bounded and N+1-free.

## Mandatory Query Bounds

Every read against the data layer should make its projection, relationship depth, result bound, and filter explicit:

| Concern | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Field selection (projection) | Without an explicit projection, the data layer returns every field on every record, including large blobs (e.g., a full body/content field). Select only what the consumer renders. |
| Relationship depth | If the data layer auto-populates related records, an unbounded or deep population fans out joins. Removing an explicit shallow depth is Critical when the consumer relies on populated relationships; an excessively deep population is Major because each level multiplies the work. |
| Result limit | Many data layers apply a small default limit silently. Flag a Critical when the consumer expects all records but no limit is set (the user will silently see a truncated subset). Match the project's established bounding pattern. |
| Filter / predicate | Required when fetching anything other than "all of this collection". Visibility-restricted reads must filter out records the caller is not allowed to see, per the project's application-security requirements (access-control rules). |

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a data-layer read omits an explicit projection, depth bound, result limit, or filter where the API supports them.
- MUST flag a Critical when a query removes an explicit shallow relationship depth while the consumer relies on populated relationships.
- MUST flag a Major when a query sets relationship depth deeper than the consumer actually needs.
- MUST require the appropriate visibility predicate (e.g., "only published / publicly-visible records") for reads that serve untrusted callers.

## N+1 Patterns to Reject

A per-record read inside a loop multiplies round-trip latency by result-set size, so a page that is instant with ten records collapses at a thousand.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when the diff iterates a list of records and issues a per-record data-layer read inside the loop. Use a single batched read (e.g., an `id IN (...)` predicate) instead, or populate relationships in the original query.
- MUST flag a Critical when a server-rendered list renders each item by awaiting its own data fetch — pre-fetch in the parent and pass the data (or a deferred handle) down, per [server-client-boundary.md](./server-client-boundary.md).
- MUST flag a Major when a write/lifecycle hook iterates a result set and performs a per-record network call serially (i.e., without batching the independent calls to run concurrently). Match the project's pattern of running independent per-record calls concurrently.

## Single Data Client Per Request

Acquiring the data-layer client carries real setup cost — connections, config, auth — and paying it repeatedly within one request buys nothing.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when the diff acquires the data-layer client more than once inside the same request scope. Cache it to a local variable and reuse it.
- MUST flag a Critical when the diff acquires the data-layer client from a non-canonical entry point. If the runtime intends a single shared (process-global) client, alternative construction paths break that singleton.

## Pagination

Silent truncation is invisible in development, where collections are small; in production, records simply stop appearing once the dataset outgrows the default limit.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when a new data-access function returns a result set directly without a comment about whether the total count exceeds the limit and will silently truncate. Either lift the limit, paginate, or document the intentional cap.
- SHOULD flag a Major when a new collection/table is queried without a defined sort — unsorted queries return records in storage-insertion order, which is not stable across data-layer schema migrations.

## Migration Cost

A migration runs against production data exactly once, and a dropped or renamed column takes its data with it — there is no second pass to recover an oversight.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when a new data-layer schema migration drops a column or renames a field on a collection/table that holds production data, without a data-backfill step. Defer to the human owner per the project's code-review guideline (escalation rules).
- MUST flag a Major when a new field used in a filter predicate is added without an index — the storage engine will full-scan. Either add an index to the field or document the expected row count.

## Locale / Variant Handling

<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL key=LOCALE — keep this section OR delete it. -->
*If this project has no per-locale or per-variant content, delete this section during INIT.*

Locale fallback makes an omitted variant parameter succeed with plausible-looking content, so the wrong variant ships without any error to catch it.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a new data-access call omits the locale/variant parameter that the project's content reads require, when the data layer supports localized or variant content.
