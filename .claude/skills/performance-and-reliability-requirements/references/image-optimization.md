# Asset and Image Optimization

Apply these rules to verify images and other large assets are sized, formatted, and rendered through the framework's optimized asset pipeline. Map "the optimized image component/pipeline" to whatever {{APP_FRAMEWORK}} provides.

## Optimized Image Pipeline Usage

Images dominate page weight, and a raw image element ships one fixed file to every device regardless of viewport, pixel density, or format support.

- Read intrinsic dimensions from the source (the data-layer record or static asset) where available, and fall back to the unoptimized path only when dimensions are unknown. Match the project's existing image-rendering pattern.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when a new unit renders a raw, unoptimized image element for any image from the data layer, a bundled asset, or a known external host. Use the framework's optimized image pipeline.
- MUST flag a Major when an optimized image is rendered without intrinsic dimensions (or the framework's fill/intrinsic-sizing mode) — without dimensions the pipeline falls back to unoptimized output and ships a layout-shift-prone image.

## Unoptimized-Path Discipline

The unoptimized path skips the byte savings and the host-allowlist check at once, so reaching for it is a performance and a security decision in the same line.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when the unoptimized image path is used with a user-controlled URL whose host is not in the project's allowlist of permitted external image hosts. Cross-reference with the project's application-security requirements (ssrf-and-embeds rules).
- MUST flag a Major when the unoptimized path is used for an image whose dimensions are known (a field on the record, or a static asset). Optimization saves bandwidth — unoptimized should be a fallback, not a default.

## Loading and Priority

Loading hints tell the browser which bytes gate first paint, so a wrong hint either delays the largest visible element or spends bandwidth on imagery nobody has scrolled to.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a new above-the-fold image is rendered without a priority/eager hint (or with lazy loading). Such imagery should load eagerly.
- MUST flag a Major when a new below-the-fold image is rendered without lazy loading. Match the project's existing body-content image pattern.

## Upload / Ingest Configuration

<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL key=IMAGES — keep this section OR delete it. -->
*If this project does not ingest user-uploaded images, delete this section during INIT.*

Ingest is the single chance to bound an asset's lifetime cost — an original stored unconverted or unbounded is served at full size on every view thereafter.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a new image-upload path is added without a configured efficient output format (or a documented reason). Match the project's shared upload-processing configuration.
- MUST flag a Major when a new upload path lacks resize bounds with a sensible upper limit (cover-fit, no enlargement, explicit max width and height) — unbounded uploads consume storage and bandwidth.
- SHOULD flag a Minor when a new derived size/variant is generated without a stated consumer — variants generate on every upload and cost storage.

## External Image Host Allowlist

Each allowlist entry authorizes the optimizer to fetch and process bytes from an external origin on demand, so entry breadth is attack surface and cost surface, not convenience.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when a new permitted external image host uses a wildcard hostname or omits a path scope. Keep entries tightly scoped to a specific host and path prefix.
- MUST flag a Major when the pattern's protocol is insecure (plain HTTP) for a non-local host. Production images should be HTTPS only.

## Image-Processing Backend

<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL key=IMAGES — keep this section OR delete it. -->
*If this project does not run a server-side image-processing backend, delete this section during INIT.*

The processing backend fails soft: uploads keep succeeding while silently skipping conversion and resizing, so its loss shows up as slow pages rather than errors.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when the diff removes the image-processing backend the upload pipeline depends on, because uploads will fall back to storing files unprocessed and break the format-conversion and resize pipeline.
- MUST flag a Major when a new upload path sets output quality higher than necessary for general media (e.g., above ~90 for lossy formats) — diminishing returns past that point.
