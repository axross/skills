# Server / Client Boundary and Async Cost

Apply these rules to verify that server/client composition (where {{APP_FRAMEWORK}} distinguishes a server tier from a client tier) does not create avoidable latency or ship unnecessary client code.

## Async Waterfalls

Sequential awaits make response time the sum of every operation's latency; concurrent execution makes it the slowest one.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when server-side code awaits independent async operations sequentially instead of running them concurrently.
- MUST flag a Critical when the diff converts a deferred / concurrent data pattern back into a serially-awaited one without a stated reason — that change re-introduces the waterfall.
- SHOULD point to the project's established pattern of deriving independent inputs and data as deferred handles passed to the units that consume them, rather than awaiting everything up front.

## Streaming / Lazy Load Granularity

<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL key=STREAMING — keep this section OR adapt it to the framework's lazy-loading mechanism. -->
*If this project's framework cannot stream or progressively render independent units, adapt this section to its lazy-loading mechanism during INIT.*

A loading boundary streams at the pace of the slowest thing inside it, so grouping independent units forces the fast one to wait for the slow one.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a single loading/streaming boundary wraps two independently-slow async units. Split into one boundary per slow unit.
- MUST flag a Major when a loading/streaming boundary is missing for an async server unit that has a meaningful loading state — without it, the whole view blocks until the data arrives.
- MUST flag a Minor when a loading fallback is provided for a side-effect-only unit (e.g., a metadata injector with no visible output). Such units should defer without a visible fallback.

## Loading / Loaded Split

Mixing loading and loaded concerns in one unit couples the skeleton to data that does not exist yet, which is how skeletons quietly stop rendering before the fetch resolves.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a new data-fetching unit does not separate its loading view, loaded view, and orchestrator when the loading state is user-visible. Match the project's canonical layout for such units.
- MUST flag a Critical when a loading skeleton imports the loaded-data type and renders fields from it — the skeleton MUST render with no data so it can show before the fetch resolves.
- MUST flag a Major when the orchestrator does not propagate the project's test-identifier convention to the loading fallback — automated tests cannot assert the skeleton state otherwise. See the project's end-to-end testing guidelines.

## Client Promotion

The client-tier boundary is transitive — a promoted unit carries every import beneath it — so one event handler can drag an entire subtree and its dependencies into the bundle.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when the diff promotes a unit to the client tier when its only client-needing reason is a small interactive subtree. Extract the interactive part and keep the parent on the server tier.
- MUST flag a Critical when promoting a unit to the client tier causes a previously server-only data fetch to ship to the browser. Lift the fetch into the server-tier parent and pass the result down as plain data.
- MUST flag a Critical when a client-tier file imports a function that itself pulls in heavyweight or server-only packages (data-layer SDK, parsing/rendering pipelines, the structured logger, an error-tracker server entry, or a server-only marker module). Cross-reference with [bundle-weight.md](./bundle-weight.md).

## Compiler / Memoization Implications

<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL key=COMPILER — keep this section OR delete it. -->
*If this project's toolchain has no auto-memoizing compiler, delete this entire subsection during INIT — heading, prose, and the **Guidelines:** block below (through the end of this section, before "Static / Dynamic Rendering Implications").*

When the framework's compiler auto-memoizes client components, the reviewer SHOULD be aware:

- Manual memoization in new client units is usually unnecessary. Flag a Minor when manual memoization is added without a reason the compiler cannot handle (e.g., a referential identity a third-party library requires).
- Such compilers typically do NOT optimize server-tier units — those re-execute on every request unless cached. Flag a Major when an expensive computation lives in an uncached server-tier unit.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST account for the framework compiler's auto-memoization behavior before flagging or approving manual memoization in new client units.

## Static / Dynamic Rendering Implications

<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL key=RENDERING — keep this section OR delete it. -->
*If this project's framework does not distinguish static from dynamic rendering, delete this subsection during INIT.*

When the framework can statically prerender server-tier units, reading per-request state (cookies, headers, request-specific parameters) typically forces the enclosing unit into dynamic rendering. The reviewer SHOULD be aware:

- Flag a Major when a previously-static view gains a new per-request read in an unexpected place (e.g., a deep child), silently opting the whole view out of static rendering.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST NOT recommend disabling the framework's compiler or static-rendering features to "fix" a perf issue — escalate to the human owner per the project's code-review guideline (escalation rules).
