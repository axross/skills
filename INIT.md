# INIT — Adapting this template to a project

This repository is a **reusable, framework-agnostic template** for a **Claude
Code** project built on an `AGENTS.md`-driven skill system. It ships:

- `AGENTS.md` — the master routing index + working agreement (the entry point
  Claude Code routes through via `CLAUDE.md`).
- `CLAUDE.md` — a one-line binding (`@AGENTS.md`) so Claude Code loads `AGENTS.md`.
- `.claude/skills/**` — a generic, cross-project **skill core** (12 guideline
  skills) plus the fixed **workflow entry-point skills** `/address` and
  `/handoff`.
- `.claude/**` — the **Claude Code** harness binding (example hooks + settings).
- `README.template.md` — a seed for the initialized project's own README
  (summary, tech stack, getting started, development workflow, testing,
  related links), finalized into `README.md` in Step 7.

Everything project-specific has been replaced with `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders or
neutral prose. This file tells an AI agent how to turn the template into a
working setup for one concrete project.

> **Fixed vs. configured — do not ask about these.** This template targets
> **Claude Code specifically**: there is no "which agent?" choice. The `/address`
> and `/handoff` workflow entry-point skills under `.claude/skills/**`, together with the
> **independent-review loop** they drive (`REVIEW.md`, the `.github/workflows/`,
> and the `github-operation-guidelines` skill), are **fixed infrastructure** —
> INIT *configures and adapts* them but **never asks whether to keep them, and
> never deletes them.** The rest of the skill core is resolved per capability in
> Steps 1 and 4: most of the 12 skills are always-present cross-project guidance,
> and a few (unit tests, e2e, observability) are added or skipped to match the
> project's stack.

> **You are the agent running INIT.** Follow the steps in order. Do not skip
> Step 0 or Step 1 — the rest depends on their answers. Make changes only inside
> this template's files. When done, INIT.md and every `<!-- INIT: ... -->` /
> "TEMPLATE NOTE" / "_template note_" scaffold should be gone.

> **Tooling.** Two helpers automate the mechanical parts; both are optional but
> recommended:
> - `./init.sh` — metacharacter-safe `{{TOKEN}}` substitution driven by
>   `tokens.json` (`./init.sh init` to scaffold a values file, `apply` to
>   substitute, `check` to run the gates). Use it instead of a hand-written
>   `sed` sweep — two tokens contain `| * ( ) \ $` and break `sed`.
> - `.claude/skills/agent-skills-best-practices/scripts/check-links.sh` —
>   relative-link integrity across the whole tree, **including** the
>   `.claude/` dot-directory that a `glob('**/*.md')` sweep silently skips.
>   Not INIT-only tooling: it ships with the agent-skills-best-practices
>   skill and survives adaptation.

## Step 0 — Reconcile pre-existing files (do this before copying anything)

You are often dropping this template into a repository that **already has** some
of these files — modern scaffolds (`create-next-app`, `create-vite`, many
others) now generate their own `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Overwriting them
silently loses real project guidance.

Before copying the template over an existing tree, check for collisions and
merge rather than clobber:

- **Existing `AGENTS.md`** — do **not** overwrite. Copy the template's
  `AGENTS.md` in as `AGENTS.template.md`, then fold any project-specific rules
  the existing file already contains (framework gotchas, "read these docs first"
  notes, house style) into the template's **Project Overview** (Step 2) or a
  project-specific skill (Step 5). Replace `AGENTS.md` only once its content is
  preserved. Concrete example: `create-next-app` generates an `AGENTS.md` whose
  one rule is load-bearing — Next.js 16 has breaking changes and ships its own
  docs in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/`; fold that into the Project Overview
  and the current-docs table, don't drop it.
- **Existing `CLAUDE.md`** — if it is already just `@AGENTS.md`, keep it. If it
  holds other instructions, append `@AGENTS.md` rather than replacing them.
- **Existing `.gitignore`** — keep the project's file; merge in the template's
  `settings.local.json` / `.env.local` entries (Step 6) instead of overwriting.
  Watch for a blanket `.env*` entry (`create-next-app` ships one): it also
  ignores the `.env.example` that `session-start.sh` copies from — replace it
  with the template's `.env.local` / `.env.*.local` entries so the example
  file stays committable.
- **Existing `README.md`** (a real project README, not this template's own) —
  do **not** let Step 7's finalize clobber it: fold `README.template.md`'s
  sections (summary, tech stack, getting started, development workflow,
  testing, related links) into the existing README there instead of renaming
  the seed over it, then delete the seed.
- **Existing `.claude/`** — merge directory-by-directory; never
  replace wholesale.

If the repository is empty/new, there is nothing to reconcile — continue.

---

## Step 1 — Interview the user (REQUIRED, do this first)

You MUST ask the user the questions below before editing any file. Ask them
together, grouped by sub-step, and batch related questions rather than
dribbling them out over many rounds. The interview is strict:

- MUST ask every area that applies to the project. Each area lists concrete
  example options — offer them, but accept any answer.
- MUST NOT infer a default for an area the user has not answered. If the user
  explicitly delegates an area ("your pick", "whatever is standard"), choose a
  sensible option and record it as a stated assumption — delegation is an
  answer; silence is not.
- MUST NOT invent the project's goal or kind under any circumstances.
- MUST record every answer — including delegated picks and "not applicable" —
  in the **Stack Decision Record** (end of this step) before starting Step 2.
- SHOULD skip asking an area whose applicability condition clearly fails
  (e.g. styling for a headless REST API), recording it as not applicable.

### 1a — Project identity

1. **Project overview.** In one or two sentences, what is the project's
   purpose / goal / what it is? (This becomes the Project Overview in
   `AGENTS.md` and the quick summary in the project README.) Also collect any
   **related links** — docs, issue tracker, deployment dashboard, design
   files — for the README's Related-links section (Step 7); "none" is a fine
   answer.
2. **Application type.** What kind of project is this?
   - Web client / full-stack web app
   - Mobile app
   - Server (RESTful API, GraphQL, WebSocket, …)
   - CLI, library, desktop app, something else

   Does it have a user-facing UI surface?

3. **Application identifier(s)** *(if the project ships an installable or
   distributable artifact whose identity is a durable reverse-DNS identifier —
   a mobile app, a desktop app, a browser extension, or a published package
   that carries one)*. This is a **MUST-ask**; never infer it.
   - Ask for the reverse-DNS **base identifier** (e.g. `app.axross.payload`)
     and derive the per-platform ids from it — the Android `applicationId` /
     package and the iOS `bundleIdentifier` — or ask for each explicitly when
     they must differ. Capture any store / distribution app IDs the artifact
     needs, and the deep-link **scheme** (a related-but-separate identifier)
     for an app that registers one.
   - **Why human-confirmed, never invented:** app identity is durable and
     expensive to change once published — store listings, distribution apps
     (e.g. Firebase), signing configs, and the deep-link scheme all key off it,
     so a post-release rename is a cross-cutting, costly migration. Consistent
     with the "MUST NOT infer a default" rule above, an agent MUST NOT invent
     it — here, or later when Step 5 scaffolds app/native config. Record the
     answer in the Stack Decision Record; like the 1c architecture decisions it
     fills no `{{TOKEN}}` (Step 5 reads it from there).
   - Record it *not applicable* for a surface-less kind that ships no such
     artifact — a headless service, a CLI, or a library whose only identity is
     its package name (already captured by `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`) — so those
     projects are not prompted.

### 1b — Core toolchain (always present)

4. **Always-present tooling.** Which does the project use for each of:
   - **App framework / runtime** — examples per application type: web
     (Next.js, Remix, …), mobile (Expo, Flutter, …), server (Hono, NestJS,
     Apollo, Express, …), or `none (plain runtime)`
   - **Primary language** (e.g. TypeScript, Python, Go)
   - **Package manager** (e.g. npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, pip)
   - **Linter** (e.g. Biome, ESLint, Ruff)
   - **Formatter** (e.g. Biome, Prettier, gofmt). If the project has **no
     dedicated formatter** (a default `create-next-app`, for example, ships
     ESLint but no Prettier), say so — see Step 3 for how to handle it.

### 1c — Architecture & structure

These answers fill no `{{TOKEN}}`; they live in the Stack Decision Record and
are consumed by Step 2 (Project Overview) and Step 5 (the structure /
component / UI-design skills). Ask each area that applies:

5. **Directory structure** (worth deciding early, especially for smaller
   apps):
   - by feature (domain A, domain B, …)
   - by purpose/type (components, hooks, persistence, …)
6. **Business-logic structure:**
   - React hooks and context-based
   - Bloc (or a similar event/state pattern)
   - Clean Architecture model-based
   - none / ad-hoc
7. **State management** *(if the app holds client-side or shared state)*:
   - client state (e.g. Zustand, Jotai, Redux)
   - server cache (e.g. TanStack Query, Apollo Client)
   - Bloc, or another pattern-supplied store
8. **Database layer** *(if the app persists data — mobile and
   server/full-stack apps especially)*: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebase
   Firestore, libSQL/SQLite, … Whether the project has, adds, or skips a
   data/content layer at all is decided in 1d; this records *which* engine.
9. **ORM / db-wrapper library** *(if the app persists data and a database
   layer was picked in item 8 — mobile and server/full-stack apps
   especially)*: Drizzle, Prisma, … — or none (raw driver/SQL).
10. **Interface / validation & sanitization** *(if the project parses external
    input — API payloads, forms, env)*: zod, valibot, …
11. **Styling** *(if the project renders UI)*: CSS Modules, Tailwind,
    Emotion, …
12. **Theming** *(if the project renders UI)*: CSS variables + Radix color
    system, React Native Unistyles, …
13. **Headless component library** *(if the project renders UI)*: Base UI,
    Radix UI, none (hand-rolled), …

### 1d — Optional capabilities

14. **For each, decide _have / add / skip_.** Do **not**
    assume these exist. A freshly scaffolded app usually has none of them, so
    the honest default is often "add" or "skip", not "delete". For each one
    ask: does the project already have it, do you want to **add** it now, or
    skip it? For **have** and **add**, the answer MUST name the tool — "we
    have unit tests" without a framework name is not a recorded decision.
    - **Unit tests** (e.g. Vitest, Jest, pytest)
    - **E2E tests** (e.g. Playwright, Cypress, Detox, Maestro)
    - **E2E scenario coverage** (a journey-catalog coverage metric over the e2e suite — which user journeys the tests assert; requires E2E tests)
    - **Error tracker** (e.g. Sentry, Rollbar)
    - **Structured logger** (e.g. Pino, Winston)
    - **Data / content layer** (e.g. Prisma, Drizzle, Payload CMS, a REST API — the engine and ORM/wrapper picked in 1c, when the project has one)
    - **Hosting platform** (e.g. Vercel, AWS, Fly.io)
    - **Per-PR preview environments** (a pipeline giving each pull request a
      stable preview link — a stable URL for a web client/server project, a
      signed installable tester-channel build for a mobile app; the rules live
      in `development-guidelines/references/preview-environments.md`). For
      **have**/**add**, name the hosting/distribution target it deploys
      through (e.g. Vercel, Fly.io, Firebase App Distribution, TestFlight).
      For a project with a deployable or installable surface, prefer **add**
      over skip: the scaffolded pipeline is preflight-gated and inert (a
      green no-op) until its accounts are configured, so adding it costs
      nothing up front. Record it *not applicable* for a project with no such
      surface (a library, a CLI).

    **Not on this list — fixed, do not ask:** GitHub operations
    (`github-operation-guidelines`) and the independent-review loop (the
    `/address` / `/handoff` skills, `REVIEW.md`, and the `.github/workflows/`)
    are **fixed infrastructure** (see the "Fixed vs. configured" note at the top).
    INIT configures and adapts them but never offers them up for deletion; record
    them as kept, and resolve their markers as "keep + adapt" in Step 4.

    Record each of the eight capabilities above as **have → _tool_**, **add →
    _tool_**, or **skip**. This single answer drives both the token fill (Step 3)
    and the keep-or-delete decision for every `<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL -->` section
    (Step 4): **have** and **add** keep the section (fill the token; **add** also
    scaffolds the tool in Step 5); **skip** deletes it — or, for infrastructure
    the project will plausibly add later, marks it **dormant** (see Step 4). (Not
    every marked section has a token: E2E scenario coverage has a Step-4 bullet
    instead of a token fill, and a few smaller marked sections — typed-language
    type safety, the unit-coverage gate, the backend/API test helpers — carry
    their keep-or-delete instruction in the marker itself. The Step-4 grep walk
    resolves them all; decide the smaller ones from the project's own shape rather
    than a Step-1 answer.)

### 1e — Agent (fixed: Claude Code)

15. **Agent — do not ask.** This template targets **Claude Code**, and only
    Claude Code; the harness binding is fixed (see Step 6). There is no "which
    agents?" question — record the agent as `Claude Code` in the Stack Decision
    Record and move on. (If a project also wants to drive these same
    `AGENTS.md` + `.claude/skills/**` files from another agent, that is a
    post-INIT addition the project makes itself, not an INIT choice.)

### Stack Decision Record

Collect every 1a–1e answer into one table — the Stack Decision Record — and
keep it for the rest of the INIT run: Step 2 (Project Overview), Step 3 (token
fill), Step 4 (optional-capability resolution), and Step 5 (project-specific
skills) all consume it. `Source` is one of `answered`, `delegated
(assumption)`, or `not applicable`:

| Area | Decision | Source |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| Application type | full-stack web app | answered |
| Application identifier | `app.axross.payload` (→ Android package + iOS bundle id) | answered |
| State management | Zustand | delegated (assumption) |
| Theming | — (headless REST API) | not applicable |

If the project already has a manifest/lockfile/config, you SHOULD read it to
confirm the answers instead of relying solely on the user — confirmation
supplements the interview; it never replaces asking. **Prefer adding a missing
capability over silently dropping it** — deleting a whole testing or
observability skill should be a deliberate choice the user made, not a default.
(The `/address` / `/handoff` skills, `REVIEW.md`, the CI workflows, and
`github-operation-guidelines` are the exception — they are fixed and never
dropped; see the "Fixed vs. configured" note.)

---

## Step 2 — Fill the Project Overview

In `AGENTS.md`, replace the `## Project Overview` placeholder block with a short,
durable description built from the Stack Decision Record (Step 1). Keep it to a
few bullets; deep layout detail — and the 1c architecture decisions — belongs
in a project-specific structure skill (Step 5), not here. Remove the
top-of-file "Template note" blockquote.

---

## Step 3 — Replace the placeholder tokens

Every `{{TOKEN}}` maps to a Stack Decision Record entry (Step 1). Replace ALL
occurrences across
`AGENTS.md`, `README.template.md`, and `.claude/**`. The table below is the
complete set used by the template (also machine-readable in `tokens.json`). Each
row gives several example values across different stacks so the substitution is
unambiguous — pick the one matching the project, or follow the same shape for a
stack not listed.

> **Use `./init.sh`, not a `sed` sweep.** Two tokens — `{{CODE_FILE_GLOB}}`
> (`*.ts | *.tsx | *.css`) and `{{CODE_FILE_REGEX}}` (`\.(ts|tsx|css)$`) —
> contain shell/regex metacharacters (`| * ( ) \ $`) that break a naive
> `sed s|...|...|` replacement. Run `./init.sh init`, fill `init.values.json`,
> then `./init.sh apply`; it substitutes literally and then runs the gates. If
> you must replace by hand, do these two literally and verify with
> `./init.sh check`.

> **No dedicated formatter?** If the project lints but has no separate formatter
> (common for a default `create-next-app`: ESLint, no Prettier), set
> `{{FORMATTER}}` to the linter's autofix (e.g. `ESLint (eslint --fix)`) and
> `{{FORMAT_CMD}}` to that command (e.g. `npx eslint --fix`). Alternatively,
> **add** a formatter (Prettier/Biome) during Step 5, or delete `format.sh` and
> the format-on-edit binding (Step 6) so the project is lint-only.

> Rule of thumb for command tokens: if the project exposes run-scripts through
> its package manager, prefer those (`npm run build`, `pnpm test`); otherwise use
> the direct tool invocation (`tsc --noEmit`, `go test ./...`). Always use the
> project's *actual* scripts when they exist — the examples are only shapes.

### Identity & stack

| Token | Fill with | Example values (pick the matching stack) |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | Project / repo name | `acme-web` · `billing-service` · `dotctl` |
| `{{PROJECT_OVERVIEW}}` | One-line goal/overview | `Internal dashboard for fleet operations.` · `CLI for managing dotfiles.` |
| `{{PROJECT_KIND}}` | Kind of project | `web app` · `mobile app` · `CLI` · `library` · `backend service` · `desktop app` |
| `{{PRIMARY_LANGUAGE}}` | Main language | `TypeScript` · `Python` · `Go` · `Rust` · `Swift` |
| `{{APP_FRAMEWORK}}` | App framework / runtime | `Next.js` · `React Native` · `Express` · `FastAPI` · `Gin` · `none (plain runtime)` |
| `{{PACKAGE_MANAGER}}` | Package manager binary (single binary only — the hooks call `command -v` on it, so a multiword value like `npx playwright` will not work) | `npm` · `pnpm` · `yarn` · `bun` · `pip` · `poetry` · `cargo` · `go` |
| `{{LINTER}}` | Linter | `Biome` · `ESLint` · `Ruff` · `golangci-lint` · `Clippy` |
| `{{FORMATTER}}` | Formatter | `Biome` · `Prettier` · `Ruff` · `gofmt` · `rustfmt` |
| `{{UNIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK}}` | Unit test framework | `Jest` · `Vitest` · `pytest` · `go test` · `cargo test` |
| `{{SOURCE_DIR}}` | Main source dir (no trailing slash — templates append the `/`) | `src` · `app` · `lib` · `internal` |
| `{{TEST_DIR}}` | Test root dir (no trailing slash — templates append the `/`) | `e2e` · `tests` · `__tests__` · `spec` |

### Optional integrations

If the project does not use one of these, **delete** the matching skill /
section instead of filling the token (see Step 4). When kept, fill the token.

| Token | Fill with | Example values | If absent |
| ----- | --------- | -------------- | --------- |
| `{{E2E_TEST_FRAMEWORK}}` | E2E test framework | `Playwright` · `Cypress` · `Detox` | delete `e2e-testing-guidelines` |
| `{{ERROR_TRACKER}}` | Error-reporting service | `Sentry` · `Rollbar` · `Bugsnag` · `Honeybadger` | delete the error-tracking sections of `observability-guidelines` |
| `{{LOGGER}}` | Structured logger | `Pino` · `Winston` · `structlog` · `zap` | delete the logging section of `observability-guidelines` |
| `{{CMS_OR_DATA_LAYER}}` | Data / content layer | `Payload CMS` · `Prisma` · `Drizzle` · `SQLAlchemy` · `a REST API` | delete the data-layer sections (marked optional) |
| `{{HOSTING_PLATFORM}}` | Hosting / deploy platform | `Vercel` · `AWS` · `Fly.io` · `Cloudflare` · `self-hosted` | leave generic or delete the mention |

### Commands

| Token | Fill with | Example values (npm-scripts · direct) |
| ----- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `{{INSTALL_CMD}}` | Install dependencies | `npm install` · `pnpm install` · `pip install -r requirements.txt` · `go mod download` |
| `{{DEV_CMD}}` | Start dev server | `npm run dev` · `pnpm dev` · `uvicorn app:app --reload` · `go run ./...` |
| `{{BUILD_CMD}}` | Production build | `npm run build` · `pnpm build` · `go build ./...` · `cargo build --release` |
| `{{START_CMD}}` | Start built app | `npm run start` · `node dist/index.js` · `./bin/app` |
| `{{FORMAT_CMD}}` | Run formatter | `npm run format` · `biome format --write .` · `ruff format .` · `gofmt -w .` |
| `{{LINT_CMD}}` | Run linter | `npm run lint` · `biome check .` · `ruff check .` · `golangci-lint run` |
| `{{TYPECHECK_CMD}}` | Type-check (drop if the language is untyped) | `npm run typecheck` · `tsc --noEmit` · `mypy .` |
| `{{UNIT_TEST_CMD}}` | Run unit tests | `npm run test:unit` · `pnpm test` · `pytest` · `go test ./...` |
| `{{E2E_TEST_CMD}}` | Run e2e tests | `npm run test:e2e` · `npx playwright test` · `cypress run` |

### Harness-hook tokens (`.claude/hooks/*.sh`)

| Token | Fill with | Example values |
| ----- | --------- | -------------- |
| `{{CODE_FILE_GLOB}}` | Shell `case` pattern of formatted extensions (`format.sh`) | `*.ts \| *.tsx \| *.css` · `*.py` · `*.go` |
| `{{CODE_FILE_REGEX}}` | Extended-regex of source extensions (`check.sh`) | `\.(ts\|tsx\|css)$` · `\.py$` · `\.go$` |

A find-and-replace sweep is the fastest path. After replacing, search the tree
for `{{` to confirm none remain (the completion checklist does this).

---

## Step 4 — Resolve optional capabilities (add or remove)

The skill core is intentionally broad. Every capability-specific block is wrapped
with a greppable marker so you can find them all:

```bash
grep -rn 'INIT:OPTIONAL' .claude .github AGENTS.md REVIEW.md README.template.md   # every optional section, with a key
```

**The loop machinery is fixed — never deleted here.** The `/address` /
`/handoff` skills, `REVIEW.md`, the `.github/workflows/`, and
`github-operation-guidelines` are permanent (see the "Fixed vs. configured" note
at the top of this file): resolve their `INIT:OPTIONAL` markers as "keep +
adapt", never as a deletion. Every *other* marked capability is resolved by its
Step-1 decision below.

For **each** marked section, apply the Step 1 decision for that capability:

- **have** / **add** → keep the section and fill its token. For **add**, also
  scaffold the tool in Step 5 (install it, add the run-script, wire the command
  token) so the kept rules describe something real. Then delete the
  `<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL ... -->` comment and the italic "_delete during INIT_"
  note, leaving the content.
- **skip** → delete the whole marked section (and, for a whole skill, follow the
  removal list below). Remove the marker, the note, and every inbound link.
  (The fixed loop machinery above is never skipped.)
- **dormant** (a middle path) → keep the section, but replace its
  `<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL ... -->` marker and italic note with a **visible**
  one-line banner, so the rule self-restores instead of vanishing:

  ```markdown
  > **Dormant until <infrastructure> exists** — remove this banner when it
  > lands, making the lens unconditional.
  ```

  Replace any unfilled `{{TOKEN}}` inside a dormant section with neutral prose
  (e.g. "the project's error tracker") and delete the token's row from
  `tokens.json` (and `init.values.json`, if already generated) — `./init.sh
  apply` refuses to run while any manifest-listed token has no value, whether
  or not it still occurs in the tree. Prefer
  **dormant** over **skip** for service-shaped capabilities the project is
  likely to acquire (an error tracker, server-side caching, a data layer): the
  rules are already correct and only their infrastructure is missing. Prefer
  **skip** for capability-shaped sections that would be re-authored anyway when
  adopted (a whole test framework) — a dormant copy of those only rots.

Do not leave a section half-resolved: a kept section MUST have its token (if any)
filled; a skipped section MUST be gone along with its links; a dormant section
MUST carry its banner and no unfilled token. The detailed removal lists below
apply to the **skip** path.

- **No error tracker AND no structured logger** → the
  `.claude/skills/observability-guidelines/` skill MAY be deleted (or
  dormant-marked per the dormant path above, when the project will plausibly
  add either tool). If only one of the two is missing, instead trim the
  sections marked `key=ERROR_TRACKER` / `key=LOGGER` inside the skill. On the
  delete path, resolve every inbound link:
  - the Observability Guidelines row of the `AGENTS.md` skill index, and the
    word "observability" in the review-lenses MUST bullet of `AGENTS.md`'s
    Review Independence Gates;
  - the "Error handling and structured logging" row of the
    developer-facing-skills table in `code-review-guideline/SKILL.md`;
  - the "Error handling, error-reporting, and logging" row of the topic table
    in `development-guidelines/SKILL.md`;
  - the `{{ERROR_TRACKER}} config and {{LOGGER}} setup` row of the
    output-surface table in `development-guidelines/references/verification.md`;
  - the `{{ERROR_TRACKER}}` row and refresh bullet in
    `development-guidelines/references/current-docs.md` (marked
    `key=ERROR_TRACKER`);
  - the `logger.info()` / `logger.warn()` phrasing in the secret-interpolation
    bullet of `application-security-requirements/references/secret-handling.md`
    (reword to "any log/console output" when the logger is dropped);
  - in `performance-and-reliability-requirements/SKILL.md` and its
    `references/error-and-observability.md`, the rules survive as the
    reviewer's checklist: drop each `per [observability-guidelines › …]` /
    "Defer the developer-facing rules to …" citation and fold the cited rule
    inline (e.g. "…not in nested helpers, so errors propagate to the root call
    site"; "the project routes errors through `reportError(...)`");
  - the start/complete log-pair SHOULD bullet in
    `performance-and-reliability-requirements/references/caching-correctness.md`
    (delete the bullet);
  - the logging-module label sub-bullet in
    `maintainable-code-guidelines/references/naming-and-organization.md`
    (delete it);
  - the empty-`try`/`catch` bullet in
    `maintainable-code-guidelines/references/complexity-and-readability.md`:
    keep the bullet but fold the rule inline — "errors are rethrown or
    reported, never swallowed" — instead of linking the rethrow rule.
- **GitHub operations** → `.claude/skills/github-operation-guidelines/` is
  **fixed — keep it** (this template drives GitHub through Claude Code + the
  GitHub MCP server, and the independent-review channel depends on it). Delete
  its `<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL -->` marker and the italic note below it,
  replace the example tool-channel, marker, and branch-prefix names with the
  project's real ones, and review its Conventions section's SHOULD bullets
  against the project's policy. A project that genuinely does no GitHub
  automation leaves the skill's rules dormant rather than deleting the skill.
- **Independent-review channel** → the `/address` and `/handoff` skills,
  `REVIEW.md`, and the `.github/workflows/*.yaml` are **fixed — keep them all.**
  This is the template's Claude delivery loop, and it requires the
  GitHub-operations capability (also fixed — keep both). Delete the
  `key=INDEPENDENT_REVIEW` and `key=SESSION_HANDOFF` markers and their italic
  notes across `REVIEW.md`, `.claude/skills/address/SKILL.md`,
  `.claude/skills/handoff/SKILL.md`, `.github/workflows/claude-review.yaml`,
  `.github/workflows/merge-checks.yaml`, the "Repository Review Policy Overlay"
  section and marked posted-review bullets in `code-review-guideline`
  (`SKILL.md`, `references/severity.md`, `references/evidence.md`,
  `references/escalation.md`), the marked SHOULD bullet in `AGENTS.md`'s Review
  Independence Gates, the marked Workflow Entry Points subsection in
  `AGENTS.md`'s Skill Index, and the marked `/address` / `/handoff` subsections in
  `README.template.md`'s Development workflow section — leaving the content in
  place — and then configure it (a project that wants no automated loop disables
  the workflow triggers and leaves the skills dormant rather than deleting
  them):
  - fill `REVIEW.md`'s do-not-report list with the checks the project's CI
    actually enforces (the `merge-checks.yaml` jobs), and review its mandatory
    checks against the project's `AGENTS.md` skill index;
  - set the review trigger phrase and reviewer identity across
    `claude-review.yaml` and the address skill
    (`.claude/skills/address/SKILL.md`). The trigger phrase
    is functional and dangerous in prose: a comment-triggered workflow matches
    it **anywhere** in a comment body, so the literal phrase belongs ONLY in
    the workflow and entry-point skill files — everywhere else refer to it as "the
    review trigger phrase";
  - replace the `@<maintainer>`, agent-comment-marker, and branch-prefix
    examples in `.claude/skills/address/SKILL.md` with the project's real values
    per `github-operation-guidelines`, and replace the generic visual-surface
    examples in `.claude/skills/address/SKILL.md` and
    `.claude/skills/address/references/visual-design-options.md` (public site
    appearance, application UI, an admin surface) with the project's real
    human-facing surfaces;
  - the `{{INSTALL_CMD}}` / `{{LINT_CMD}}` / `{{UNIT_TEST_CMD}}` run commands
    in `merge-checks.yaml` are substituted by `./init.sh apply` like every
    other token; only the toolchain setup (setup-node, `.nvmrc`, the npm
    cache) is not a token — replace it with the project's own by hand.
    The template ships no `.nvmrc`: even a project keeping the npm-flavored
    setup must create one (or switch `setup-node` to `node-version:`), or
    both jobs fail at Setup Node on every run. Note both jobs self-skip
    their real steps (and pass) while `INIT.md` exists; deleting the INIT
    tooling in Step 7 is what arms them, so a green Merge Checks before
    that point does not mean lint/tests ran.
- **Per-PR preview environments** → resolve every `key=PREVIEW_ENVIRONMENTS`
  site (the Step-4 grep finds them all) per the Step-1 decision. The six
  sites: `development-guidelines/references/preview-environments.md` (the whole
  file), its "Preview Environments" routing section in
  `development-guidelines/SKILL.md`, the stable-preview-link bullet in
  `development-guidelines/references/verification.md`, the "Preview Environment
  Exposure" section in
  `application-security-requirements/references/privacy-and-exposure.md`, the
  preview-environments routing bullet in
  `application-security-requirements/SKILL.md`'s Privacy and Exposure Control
  section, and the marked subsection in `README.template.md`'s Development
  workflow.
  - **have** / **add** → keep all six sites: delete the markers and italic
    notes, replace the illustrative tool names with the project's real
    hosting/distribution stack, and author the concrete workflow in Step 5.
  - **skip** → delete all six sites, plus the "per-PR preview environments" /
    "preview environments" phrases in `development-guidelines/SKILL.md`'s
    frontmatter `description` and `when_to_use`.
  - **dormant** fits this capability well when the project will plausibly
    deploy later: the pipeline the reference describes is preflight-gated and
    inert by design, so the kept rules cost nothing until the infrastructure
    exists.
- **No e2e framework** → delete `.claude/skills/e2e-testing-guidelines/` and
  its index row, then remove every inbound link to it:
  - `quality-assurance-guidelines/references/e2e-coverage.md` (delete the file)
    and its pointer in `quality-assurance-guidelines/SKILL.md`;
  - the `../e2e-testing-guidelines/SKILL.md` link in
    `quality-assurance-guidelines/SKILL.md`;
  - the `../../e2e-testing-guidelines/SKILL.md` link in
    `unit-test-guidelines/references/testing-scope.md`;
  - the `../e2e-testing-guidelines/SKILL.md` link in
    `product-requirement-guidelines/SKILL.md`;
  - the e2e row of the topic table in `development-guidelines/SKILL.md`;
  - the e2e row of the developer-facing-skills table in
    `code-review-guideline/SKILL.md`;
  - the `../../e2e-testing-guidelines/SKILL.md` link in
    `performance-and-reliability-requirements/references/server-client-boundary.md`;
  - the e2e-authoring pointer in
    `development-guidelines/references/verification.md`;
  - the `{{E2E_TEST_CMD}}` bullet in the `AGENTS.md` Verification section;
  - the marked e2e rows in `README.template.md`'s Tech stack and Testing
    tables.

  Deleting the e2e skill also removes every `key=SCENARIO_COVERAGE` site (next
  bullet) — the two that live outside `e2e-testing-guidelines/` are inside
  `quality-assurance-guidelines` files deleted or trimmed above.
- **E2E suite kept, but no scenario-coverage catalog** → delete every
  `INIT:OPTIONAL key=SCENARIO_COVERAGE` site:
  - `e2e-testing-guidelines/references/scenario-coverage.md` (delete the file)
    and its "E2E Scenario Coverage" routing section in
    `e2e-testing-guidelines/SKILL.md`;
  - the "Scenario Coverage" section in
    `quality-assurance-guidelines/references/e2e-coverage.md` and the marked
    scenario-coverage bullet in `quality-assurance-guidelines/SKILL.md`.

  If the project **adopts** it, keep all four sites, delete the markers and
  italic notes, and then in Step 5 author the journey catalog (e.g.
  `scenarios.md` in `{{TEST_DIR}}`), pick the tag syntax
  `{{E2E_TEST_FRAMEWORK}}` supports, and build the coverage reporter and gate
  script — the template ships the convention only, no implementation.
- **No unit test framework** → delete `.claude/skills/unit-test-guidelines/`
  and its index row, then remove every inbound link to it:
  - the `../unit-test-guidelines/SKILL.md` link in
    `product-requirement-guidelines/SKILL.md`;
  - the unit-test row of the developer-facing-skills table in
    `code-review-guideline/SKILL.md`;
  - the `{{UNIT_TEST_CMD}}` bullet in the `AGENTS.md` Verification section;
  - the marked unit-test rows in `README.template.md`'s Tech stack and
    Testing tables.
- **No data/content layer** → delete every `key=DATA_LAYER` site (the Step-4
  grep finds them all): the marked sections in `development-guidelines`
  (`dev-commands.md`, `change-management.md`, plus the `current-docs.md` row
  and bullet), `application-security-requirements` (`access-control.md`),
  `performance-and-reliability-requirements`
  (`references/data-access-efficiency.md` — the whole file — and its
  "Data-Access Efficiency" section in `SKILL.md`), and
  `maintainable-code-guidelines` (`abstraction-boundaries.md` — rewrite the
  Data-Access / UI Split bullets around the project's actual persistence
  boundary — and the realm row/bullet in `naming-and-organization.md`), plus
  the marked data-layer row in `README.template.md`'s Tech stack table. Then
  sweep the prose: the "data-layer/migration handling" / "migrations" phrases
  in `development-guidelines/SKILL.md`'s description and body, the
  data-access/data-layer phrases in the `AGENTS.md` index rows
  (Development Guidelines, Performance and Reliability) and in `AGENTS.md`'s
  high-risk and Verification bullets, and the data-layer mentions in
  `performance-and-reliability-requirements/SKILL.md`'s description.
- **No authentication system** (nothing logs in — no accounts, sessions, or
  admin surface) → delete every `key=AUTH` site:
  `application-security-requirements/references/auth-and-session.md` (move its
  auth-independent "Localhost / Production Divergence" section into
  `privacy-and-exposure.md` first) and, when the project also has no data
  layer, `references/access-control.md` entirely; then remove their routing
  sections ("Access Control", "Auth and Session Management") from that skill's
  `SKILL.md`, the auth phrases from its frontmatter description and the
  `AGENTS.md` index row, and the inbound access-control link in
  `performance-and-reliability-requirements/references/data-access-efficiency.md`
  (itself deleted on the no-data-layer path). Verify with
  `.claude/skills/agent-skills-best-practices/scripts/check-links.sh`.
- **No client bundle / not a UI project** → remove the "User-Facing Work"
  subsection from `AGENTS.md` and the bundling/asset sections (marked optional)
  in `performance-and-reliability-requirements`.
- Walk every `<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL ... -->` marker (the grep above) and resolve
  each one as **have/add/skip** per Step 1.

Whenever you remove a skill, also remove every relative link pointing to it so
no dangling links remain. Verify with
`.claude/skills/agent-skills-best-practices/scripts/check-links.sh`.

## Step 5 — Add project-specific skills

The template deliberately ships only the cross-project core. Recreate the
project's own skills as needed, following
[Agent Skills Best Practices](.claude/skills/agent-skills-best-practices/SKILL.md)
and its
[project-skill archetypes](.claude/skills/agent-skills-best-practices/references/project-skill-archetypes.md)
reference — section-by-section skeletons for the skills below. Common ones to
add:

- **Project Structure** — repository layout, stack, services, file placement.
  Create this first; `AGENTS.md` already points at it. Its Stack section MUST
  record the Stack Decision Record's directory-structure, business-logic
  structure, state-management, database-engine, ORM/db-wrapper, and
  validation/sanitization decisions (1c).
- **Component / UI skills** — if the project has a UI (component conventions,
  styling, UI design principles, accessibility). These MUST record the Stack
  Decision Record's headless-component-library, styling, and theming decisions
  (1c).
- **Routing** — if the project has a routing layer.
- **Domain skills** — content authoring, data-model/CMS operations, or any
  domain workflow specific to this project.

For each new skill: add a directory under `.claude/skills/<name>/` with a
`SKILL.md`, then add a row to the `AGENTS.md` skill index (there is a commented
example block there) and to the review-lens lists in
`code-review-guideline` / `development-guidelines` where relevant.

**Scaffolding capabilities chosen as "add" in Step 1.** When the user opted to
add a capability rather than skip it, set it up for real here so the kept rules
are not aspirational:

- **Unit tests** → install the runner (e.g. `vitest`), add a `test:unit`
  run-script, fill `{{UNIT_TEST_FRAMEWORK}}` / `{{UNIT_TEST_CMD}}`, and create a
  first example test. Keep `unit-test-guidelines`.
- **E2E tests** → install the runner (e.g. `@playwright/test`), add a
  `test:e2e` script, fill `{{E2E_TEST_FRAMEWORK}}` / `{{E2E_TEST_CMD}}` /
  `{{TEST_DIR}}`. Keep `e2e-testing-guidelines`.
- **E2E scenario coverage** → author the journey catalog (e.g. `scenarios.md`
  in `{{TEST_DIR}}`), tag the asserting tests, and build the coverage
  reporter/gate wired into the e2e run. Keep the marked `SCENARIO_COVERAGE`
  sections.
- **Error tracker / logger** → add the dependency and its init, fill
  `{{ERROR_TRACKER}}` / `{{LOGGER}}`. Keep `observability-guidelines`.
- **Per-PR preview environments** → author the concrete pipeline for the
  project's actual stack per
  `development-guidelines/references/preview-environments.md`. For a web
  client/server project: a `.github/workflows/preview-deploy.yaml` that
  provisions the PR's isolated backing resources, deploys the preview,
  re-points a deterministic stable alias (`<prefix>-pr-<n>`) at the newest
  deployment, comments the stable URL with the deployed short SHA, and tears
  everything down on close. For a mobile app: a dispatched preview-build
  workflow that produces a signed build, distributes it through the tester
  channel (e.g. Firebase App Distribution, TestFlight), and comments the
  install link on the PR. Either way, follow the reference's core rules
  (preflight inert gating, per-PR data isolation, a fresh comment per deploy,
  fail-loud stable link) and document the required secrets/vars in the
  project README so the maintainer can complete the one-time account setup.
- **Formatter** → add it (e.g. Prettier/Biome), add a `format` script, fill
  `{{FORMATTER}}` / `{{FORMAT_CMD}}`.

Confirm each added command actually runs before relying on the `check.sh` /
`format.sh` hooks that call it.

**Application identifier(s) — use the confirmed answer, never invent one.** When
the Stack Decision Record records an application identifier (§1a, item 3),
every generated app, native, or distribution config MUST take the identifier
verbatim from that recorded answer and MUST NOT invent one: Expo `app.json`
(`android.package` / `ios.bundleIdentifier`), any `AndroidManifest.xml` /
`Info.plist`-shaping config, a Fastlane `Appfile`, the store / distribution app
IDs, the deep-link scheme, and e2e `appId` selectors must all agree — app
identity is expensive to change once published (see §1a). A surface-less kind
recorded the area *not applicable*, so none of this applies to it.

---

## Step 6 — Set up the Claude Code harness binding

`AGENTS.md` + `.claude/skills/**` are the portable substance. This template
targets **Claude Code** (fixed — Step 1e), which reads them through the
`.claude/` binding:

- **Claude Code** — `CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md`) plus the `.claude/` directory:
  - `.claude/skills/**` is also discovered natively by Claude Code, so each
    skill is directly invocable in addition to being routed via `AGENTS.md`.
  - `.claude/settings.json` wires the `SessionStart` hook and sets the
    default reasoning effort level (`effortLevel`; ships as `xhigh`).
  - `.claude/settings.local-example.json` is the opt-in quality binding
    (format-on-edit + lint/test-before-stop); the session-start hook copies it
    to `settings.local.json` in cloud sessions.
  - `.claude/hooks/*.sh` are **examples** — fill `{{CODE_FILE_GLOB}}`,
    `{{CODE_FILE_REGEX}}`, `{{INSTALL_CMD}}`, command tokens, and adapt the
    toolchain-provisioning block in `session-start.sh` to the project's runtime
    (the example uses `mise` + Node). Delete any hook the project doesn't want.
  - The session-start hook materializes `settings.local.json` and `.env.local`.
    The template ships a `.gitignore` that excludes both (the
    `application-security` skill assumes they are gitignored) — keep those entries
    and merge the rest of the project's ignores into it. If the project keeps its
    own `.gitignore` elsewhere, move these entries there instead.
The Claude Code binding is the only one to set up — there is no per-agent choice
to make. A project that later wants to also drive the same
`AGENTS.md` + `.claude/skills/**` from another agent (Cursor, Copilot, Aider, …)
adds that binding itself, outside INIT, by pointing the agent at `AGENTS.md` via
its own mechanism; the portable substance already supports it.

---

## Step 7 — Finalize

- Finalize the project README from its seed:
  `git mv -f README.template.md README.md` (replacing the template's own
  README — but when the repository already had its own real README, merge the
  seed's sections into it instead and delete the seed; see Step 0),
  then complete it against the Stack Decision Record and the Step-1 answers —
  expand the quick summary into a short paragraph, trim the Tech stack table
  to what the project actually uses, verify the Getting-started commands run,
  resolve the Development-workflow and Testing markers against the kept
  capabilities, and fill Related links (or delete that section) — and delete
  every `<!-- INIT… -->` comment in it. The finished README MUST cover: a
  quick summary, the tech stack, getting started, the development workflow
  (including `/address`, which is fixed infrastructure), the testing strategy
  and its commands, and related links (when applicable).
- Run `./init.sh check` and resolve everything it reports.
- Walk the completion checklist below **while the INIT tooling still exists** —
  several items run `./init.sh check`, and checking them after the deletion
  step would leave those items with no runnable command.
- Then delete the INIT tooling — all of it, unconditionally: `INIT.md`,
  `init.sh`, `tokens.json`, `init.values.json`, and
  `.github/workflows/template-checks.yaml` (the template repository's own CI).
  None of these are meant to survive adaptation; a leftover copy is dead
  weight that only rots. The link checker
  (`.claude/skills/agent-skills-best-practices/scripts/check-links.sh`) is
  **not** INIT tooling — it ships with the agent-skills-best-practices skill
  and stays. If the project wants an ongoing docs-link gate, wire that script
  into its own CI as ordinary project work.
- Remove the "Template note" blockquote at the top of `AGENTS.md`, every
  `<!-- INIT:OPTIONAL ... -->` marker and `<!-- INIT: ... -->` fill-in comment,
  and every "TEMPLATE NOTE" / "_delete during INIT_" line for sections you
  decided to keep.

### Completion checklist

- [ ] No `{{TOKEN}}`s remain in authored files (build/VCS dirs excluded):
      `./init.sh check` (or `grep -rnE '\{\{[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*\}\}' .
      --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.next --exclude-dir=.git`).
      The uppercase-token pattern matters when the independent-review
      workflows are kept: GitHub Actions `${{ ... }}` expressions contain
      `{{` but are lowercase, so they never match, while leftover tokens in
      `.github/` (e.g. `merge-checks.yaml`'s run commands) are caught.
- [ ] No `<!-- INIT… -->` markers remain — neither `INIT:OPTIONAL` capability
      markers nor `INIT:` fill-in comments: `grep -rn '<!-- INIT' .`
- [ ] No dangling relative skill links:
      `.claude/skills/agent-skills-best-practices/scripts/check-links.sh`
      (checks the `.claude/` tree a `glob('**/*.md')` sweep would skip).
- [ ] `AGENTS.md` skill index matches the directories under `.claude/skills/`.
- [ ] Removed skills have no remaining inbound links (the fixed loop machinery —
      `/address`, `/handoff`, `REVIEW.md`, the workflows, `github-operation-guidelines` —
      is never removed).
- [ ] The conditional hedges are resolved — in every bullet hedged with a
      "when the project has …" clause, delete the clause when the capability
      was kept and the whole bullet when it was skipped. They live in
      `AGENTS.md`'s Verification section (the `{{UNIT_TEST_CMD}}`,
      `{{E2E_TEST_CMD}}`, and `{{BUILD_CMD}}` bullets) **and** outside it:
      `development-guidelines/references/dev-commands.md` (build, unit, e2e
      bullets), `references/code-quality.md` (check-sequence test step),
      `references/verification.md` (the e2e-suite bullet), and
      `unit-test-guidelines/references/review-checklist.md` (the typecheck
      clause). Grep for `when the project has` to catch them all.
- [ ] Skipped capabilities no longer appear in prose: grep the tree for each
      skipped tool's name and for generic phrases like "data layer",
      "structured logger", or "error tracker" in skill descriptions and
      `AGENTS.md` index rows, and reword or delete the stragglers.
- [ ] Every skill removed in Step 4 is also gone from the review-lenses MUST
      bullet in `AGENTS.md`'s Review Independence Gates (e.g. drop
      "observability" when `observability-guidelines` was deleted).
- [ ] Added capabilities have a working command (the `check.sh` / `format.sh`
      hooks actually run).
- [ ] `merge-checks.yaml` is kept (fixed): its jobs actually run the lint/test
      steps instead of skipping them — the guard steps disarm once `INIT.md`
      is deleted, so check a post-INIT run's log shows the steps executing.
- [ ] Per-PR preview environments are resolved: kept scaffolding has an
      authored workflow that is preflight-gated (it merges green before any
      account setup) with its required secrets/vars documented in the README;
      a skipped capability leaves no `key=PREVIEW_ENVIRONMENTS` site, inbound
      link, or prose straggler behind.
- [ ] The Claude Code harness binding is filled in and runnable.
- [ ] A `.gitignore` excludes `settings.local.json` and `.env.local` (or the
      project's equivalent local-state/secret files).
- [ ] `INIT.md` and template scaffolding notes/tooling are deleted — including
      `init.sh`, `tokens.json`, `init.values.json`, and
      `.github/workflows/template-checks.yaml`.
- [ ] The README seed is finalized: `README.template.md` is gone (renamed
      over — or merged into — `README.md`), no `<!-- INIT… -->` comment or
      `{{TOKEN}}` remains in
      `README.md`, and it covers the quick summary, tech stack, getting
      started, development workflow, testing strategy and commands, and
      related links (or that section was deliberately dropped). The template's
      own README — the one titled "Claude Loop Engineering Template" — no
      longer exists.
