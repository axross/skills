# Summary and Background Framing

Apply this reference when drafting or reviewing the document sections that state what is needed and why — **Summary**, **Background** with its **Goals**, **Non-goals**, and **Assumptions** subsections, and the trailing **Open questions** section — before any UI, system-design, or implementation detail. Sourced from PRD-, RFC-, and requirements-writing practice: [Perforce's PRD guide](https://www.perforce.com/blog/alm/how-write-product-requirements-document-prd), [ProductPlan's problem-statement guide](https://www.productplan.com/learn/guide-to-writing-an-effective-problem-statement), [Intercom's "start with a problem statement"](https://www.intercom.com/blog/how-to-write-problem-statements/), [Product Talk on product outcomes](https://www.producttalk.org/product-outcomes/), [Google's design-docs practice](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/design-docs-at-google/), the [Rust RFC template](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/0000-template.md), the [RFC Style Guide (RFC 7322)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7322), and [GitHub's native mermaid rendering](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/).

## Summary

The Summary is the document's funnel mouth: RFC and design-doc practice converges on opening with a short overview a reader can stop after — Rust RFCs limit it to one paragraph, IETF's style guide requires an abstract that stands alone without the body, and Google design docs open with context a relative newcomer can absorb. A Summary earns its place when a reader who reads nothing else still knows what the work is and what goal it serves.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST open the document with a single-paragraph Summary explaining the work and its goal.
- MUST make the Summary readable standalone: no forward references to later sections, no undefined shorthand, no reliance on an external issue thread.
- MUST keep motivation depth and circumstance detail out of the Summary; they belong in Background.

## Background

Background states the circumstances that make the work worth doing — neutrally, without embedding the chosen solution. Problem-first ordering is universal across RFC templates and PRD practice, and a brief that smuggles the solution into the problem statement forecloses design judgment that belongs later. Concise bullets beat prose paragraphs for scannability, and where the renderer supports diagrams (GitHub renders mermaid natively in issues and Markdown), a small diagram is often the clearest way to show a situation — a failing data flow, a tangled dependency, a before/after shape.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST state the circumstances and the problem before any solution, UI, or system-design detail, and keep "how" out of this section.
- SHOULD write Background as a concise bullet list rather than paragraphs.
- SHOULD add a diagram when it clarifies the circumstances better than prose — and skip it when it would only decorate.
- SHOULD ground the problem in the underlying need it serves rather than a literal feature request, so the requirement stays stable if the chosen solution changes.
- SHOULD link out to supporting research or prior discussion rather than inlining it.

## Goals

Goals make the work's purpose checkable: each one names an achievable outcome the reader can hold the finished work against. Outcome-based framing — the change in user or system behavior sought — is preferred over output-based framing (the artifact being shipped), since output-only specs risk shipping work without moving anything real.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST list concise, achievable goals as bullets under Background, each explaining part of the work's purpose.
- SHOULD frame each goal as a change in behavior or capability, not as the artifact being built.

## Non-Goals and Out-of-Scope

Non-goals are a decision, not a disclaimer. Design-doc practice at Google treats "Non-Goals" as things that could reasonably have been in scope but were deliberately excluded — not a restatement of the goal in the negative. Pairing every goal list with an equally visible non-goal list pre-empts "can we just add X" requests once work is underway.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST write explicit non-goals as a subsection beside Goals whenever the boundary is easy to misread.
- MUST phrase each non-goal as a deliberate exclusion of something that could plausibly have been included, not as a negated goal.
- SHOULD route a later request that falls outside the stated non-goals through explicit scope evaluation rather than silently absorbing it into the current change.

## Assumptions vs. Open Questions

Assumptions and open questions are easy to conflate but serve different readers and live in different places. An assumption is a stated belief the plan relies on and would need to revisit if wrong — it sits early, under Background, where the reader forms their model of the work. An open question is an unresolved item; a _blocking_ one is asked before the plan is finalized, while a non-blocking one is recorded in the trailing Open questions section (see below).

**Guidelines:**

- MUST state assumptions and constraints the plan relies on in the Assumptions subsection under Background, distinct from open questions.
- MUST NOT embed an unresolved product, platform, privacy, compatibility, or scope decision silently as an assumption; surface it as an explicit question to the human instead, since a wrong silent assumption is more expensive to unwind than an asked question.
- SHOULD flag an assumption the reader is likely to disagree with rather than build around it unstated.

## Open Questions and Risks

The document ends with an Open questions section — the RFC tradition's "Unresolved questions", explicitly TBD-friendly so drafting is never blocked on having every answer. It is the document's historical margin: unresolved non-blocking items, and known hazards recorded as risks with their mitigation, kept where humans and AI agents can salvage them later. A known hazard is a risk, not a question — write it with its mitigation rather than as an open-ended unknown.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST end the document with an Open questions section; "None" is a valid entry and still worth stating.
- MUST record only non-blocking items here; a question that blocks confident planning is asked before the plan is finalized, never parked.
- SHOULD record a known hazard as a risk with its mitigation (e.g., "Risk: X may happen — mitigated by Y"), distinct from genuine unknowns.

## Right-Sizing Scope

Formality tracks risk and reversibility, not a fixed template. Cross-team, irreversible, or high-blast-radius changes warrant a fuller document with alternatives and non-goals; a small, easily reversible change warrants a short line per section. Shape Up's appetite-first approach — fixing the time or resource budget and shaping scope to fit it — is a disciplined way to right-size scope instead of letting an open-ended feature list dictate it.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST right-size each section to the change: a one-line copy fix needs a sentence per required section, not a multi-paragraph spec; a cross-cutting feature needs more.
- SHOULD add detail only as decisions stabilize rather than speculatively covering capabilities not yet needed.
- SHOULD scale formality to the change's risk and reversibility, not to a fixed section template.

## Concrete, Checkable Language

Vague quality adjectives are a measured defect, not a style nitpick: empirical requirements-smell research ties subjective terms like "user-friendly," "fast," "intuitive," or "seamless" directly to lower testability and higher downstream defect risk. Classic requirements guidance names the same failure mode as words to avoid without a measurable follow-up.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST replace vague quality adjectives ("user-friendly", "fast", "intuitive", "clean", "seamless") with concrete, checkable statements.
- MUST keep each requirement to one thing with only one reasonable interpretation (atomic: one requirement, one interpretation).
- MUST name the exact copy, threshold, attribute, or state transition expected instead of describing a quality in the abstract.
